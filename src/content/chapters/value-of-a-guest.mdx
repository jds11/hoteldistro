title: "The Value of a Guest"
---


## Opening Vignette

It is a Friday evening in October, and two guests check in to a 250-room boutique hotel in downtown Chicago within minutes of each other. Both are staying in a standard king room. Both are paying $249 per night for a two-night weekend stay. On paper, they look identical: same room type, same rate, same length of stay. The front desk agent processes both reservations with the same warm smile.

But behind the scenes, these two guests could not be more different.

Guest A booked through an online travel agency. The hotel will pay a 22% commission on the room revenue — roughly $110 over the two-night stay. Guest A has never stayed at this property before, has no loyalty membership, and selected the hotel primarily because it appeared on the first page of OTA search results with a "15% off" badge. During the stay, Guest A eats breakfast at a café down the street, skips the hotel bar, and leaves without providing an email address. The hotel has no way to contact this guest again. When Guest A needs a hotel in Chicago next year, the search will start from scratch — on the OTA.

Guest B booked directly through the hotel's website after receiving a personalized email from the hotel's CRM system. Guest B is a loyalty program member on her twelfth stay with the brand. The cost of acquiring this reservation was less than $5 in email marketing costs. Over the weekend, Guest B has dinner at the hotel restaurant ($127), orders room service for breakfast ($42), and books a 60-minute spa treatment ($185). She leaves a glowing review on TripAdvisor, tags the hotel in an Instagram story seen by 1,400 followers, and has already booked her next stay — a four-night trip in March — before checking out.

Same room. Same rate. Same night. But Guest B is worth more than ten times what Guest A is worth — not just on this visit, but over the lifetime of the relationship.

This chapter is about learning to see that difference. Because in the business of hospitality distribution, the real question is not just *how many rooms did we sell?* but *to whom did we sell them, through which channel, and at what true cost?*


## Learning Objectives

After reading this chapter, you should be able to:

1. **Define and calculate** Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) in a hospitality context and explain why it should inform distribution strategy.
2. **Compare the true cost of guest acquisition** across major distribution channels, including OTAs, GDS, metasearch, and direct channels.
3. **Explain Net RevPAR** and articulate why it is a more meaningful profitability metric than gross RevPAR for distribution decisions.
4. **Evaluate the billboard effect** hypothesis, weighing evidence for and against OTA-driven awareness that leads to direct bookings.
5. **Analyze how distribution channel choice** affects ancillary revenue, guest data ownership, and long-term relationship economics.


## 3.1 Rethinking Revenue: Why Not All Bookings Are Created Equal

### The Limits of Top-Line Thinking

For decades, the hotel industry has been governed by a single sacred metric: Revenue Per Available Room, or RevPAR. Calculated as occupancy multiplied by average daily rate (ADR), RevPAR provides a clean snapshot of how well a hotel is monetizing its inventory. It is the number that appears in STR reports, the number that owners scrutinize in asset management meetings, and the number that general managers are often compensated against.

But RevPAR has a blind spot. It treats every dollar of room revenue as equal, regardless of what it cost to earn that dollar. A $200 room night booked through brand.com and a $200 room night booked through an OTA generate identical RevPAR — yet the hotel may net $195 from one and $155 from the other. When distribution costs vary by as much as 15–25% of room revenue depending on the channel, ignoring the cost side of the equation is like evaluating a restaurant's success by its gross sales without looking at food costs (Estis Green & Lomanno, 2012).

This is the fundamental insight that animates this chapter: **the value of a guest is not determined by the rate they pay, but by the net revenue they generate, the ancillary spend they contribute, and the lifetime relationship they represent.** Understanding this principle — and embedding it into distribution strategy — is the difference between a hotel that fills rooms and a hotel that builds sustainable profitability.

### A Brief History of Distribution Cost Awareness

The hospitality industry's reckoning with distribution costs has been gradual. In the pre-internet era, distribution was relatively straightforward: guests called the hotel or a travel agent made a GDS booking, and commissions were a manageable 10% (Estis Green & Lomanno, 2012). The rise of OTAs in the late 1990s and early 2000s introduced a new cost structure — commissions of 15–25% — but many hoteliers initially welcomed the incremental demand, particularly during the post-9/11 downturn and the 2008 financial crisis, when any booking felt like a good booking. It was not until the recovery periods following these downturns that the industry began to question whether OTA-dependent growth was sustainable. The HSMAI Foundation's landmark 2012 *Distribution Channel Analysis* sounded an early alarm, arguing that hoteliers needed to understand "the net contribution of each segment from each channel" rather than simply chasing top-line revenue (Estis Green & Lomanno, 2012, p. 11). Cornell University's Center for Hospitality Research produced a series of influential studies examining distribution costs, the billboard effect, and channel optimization throughout the 2010s, laying the academic groundwork for a more sophisticated approach to guest value (Anderson, 2009; Anderson, 2011).

The HSMAI study also introduced a distribution cost framework that remains the standard analytical approach:

> **Total Distribution Cost = (Commission Costs + Marketing/Reservation Fees + Technology Costs + Personnel Costs) ÷ Room Revenue**

Key metrics in this framework include Net RevPAR, revenue-to-cost ratio by channel, customer lifetime value, and flow-through analysis (Estis Green & Lomanno, 2012, p. 15).

Today, the conversation has matured. Leading hotel companies track Net RevPAR, calculate customer lifetime value, and make channel-level investment decisions based on total guest economics. The urgency has only intensified: with U.S. hotel labor costs rising 9% per available room in 2025 and overall expense growth of 5–10% outpacing revenue growth of 0–3%, the margin pressure makes every distribution dollar count (O'Neill, 2025b). Skift Research's 2025 analysis of U.S. hotel profitability quantifies the gap starkly: while total revenue per available room (TRevPAR) reached **$232** in June 2025 — slightly above the $226 recorded in June 2019 — gross operating profits per available room (GOPPAR) stood at just **$85**, still **7% below** the June 2019 figure of $91 (Agarwal, 2025f). The industry's gross operating profit margin has compressed to **37%**, four percentage points below 2019 levels, driven by total operating expenses of **$147 per room night**, with labor alone accounting for **$78 per room night** — 54% of total costs and tracking 10% above 2019 levels (Agarwal, 2025f). This divergence between top-line recovery and bottom-line pressure makes the cost side of distribution — the focus of this chapter — more consequential than ever.

One bright spot complicates the narrative: luxury and ultra-luxury hotels have been the only chain scales to experience margin *expansion* over the past year. Ultra-luxury hotels posted TRevPAR growth of **7.5%** and GOPPAR growth of **8.7%** in H1 2025, even as upper-midscale hotels recorded a margin contraction of 1.4% (Agarwal, 2025f). Laura Resco of HotStats attributes this to luxury's multiple non-room revenue streams — F&B outlets, spa, golf — that attract both hotel guests and locals, "providing a layer of protection when occupancy still struggles to pick up" (as cited in Agarwal, 2025f). For distribution strategists, the implication is clear: channel cost optimization matters most in the segments where margins are thinnest. Independent hotels, which often lack the data infrastructure to see the full picture, remain especially exposed.

A 2025 HSMAI Revenue Optimization Advisory Board discussion underscored the challenge. While several hotel companies are working toward a reservation-level view of distribution costs using BI platforms like Juyo Analytics and Kalibri Labs' Hummingbird, there is no consensus on how granular the analysis needs to be. One advisory board member cautioned against assuming direct bookings are automatically cheaper: "Just because you are throwing money at that to drive direct bookings does not always mean you end up keeping as much of that as you think" (Acosta, 2025). The board emphasized that loyalty program costs — discounted rates, free breakfasts, upgrades — frequently go unaccounted for in distribution cost analyses, distorting the true comparison between channels.


## 3.2 Customer Lifetime Value: The Metric That Changes Everything

### What Is Customer Lifetime Value?

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV, also referred to as LTV or CLTV) is a projection of the total net revenue a business can expect from a single customer over the entire duration of their relationship. It remains one of the most important — and most underutilized — metrics in hospitality. Webb, Cho, and Legg (2022) developed a CLV modeling framework specifically for hospitality applications, demonstrating how data science techniques can help hotels predict which guests will generate the most long-term value — and allocate acquisition spending accordingly.

In its simplest form, CLV can be expressed as:

> **CLV = (Average Revenue per Stay × Number of Stays per Year × Average Relationship Length in Years) − Total Acquisition and Retention Costs**

For a more precise calculation, hospitality companies factor in:

- **Room revenue per stay** (net of distribution costs)
- **Ancillary revenue per stay** (food & beverage, spa, parking, minibar, resort fees, etc.)
- **Visit frequency** (number of stays per year)
- **Retention rate** (probability that the guest returns in the next period)
- **Discount rate** (to calculate the net present value of future cash flows)
- **Acquisition cost** (the initial cost to win the guest)
- **Retention cost** (ongoing marketing, loyalty program costs, and service investments)

Guest B is worth more than **17 times** Guest A — and this calculation does not even account for the referral value of Guest B's social media posts, word-of-mouth recommendations, or the data the hotel captures from each interaction to personalize future stays.

### Why CLV Matters for Distribution Decisions

CLV reframes distribution as an investment rather than a transaction. When a revenue manager evaluates whether to allocate rooms to an OTA or hold them for direct bookings, CLV provides the framework to think beyond tonight's occupancy and consider the downstream value of each guest relationship.

Marriott International has been one of the most vocal advocates for CLV-based thinking. The company's "Marriott Bonvoy" loyalty program — with over 200 million members as of 2024 — is fundamentally a CLV engine. Members book more frequently, spend more per stay, and cost less to acquire on return visits. According to Marriott's investor presentations, loyalty members account for approximately 50% of room nights and tend to book through lower-cost direct channels (Marriott International, 2024).

Hilton has taken a similar approach. In 2016, the company launched its "Stop Clicking Around" campaign, investing over $100 million in marketing to convince travelers to book directly through Hilton's channels in exchange for the lowest price and loyalty points. The campaign was explicitly designed to shift distribution mix toward direct channels, reducing OTA dependency and increasing the proportion of high-CLV guests (Hilton Worldwide, 2016).


## 3.3 The True Cost of Guest Acquisition

### Breaking Down Distribution Costs by Channel

Not all bookings cost the same to acquire. The distribution cost structure varies dramatically across channels, and understanding these differences is essential for evaluating the true profitability of each reservation. The following breakdown reflects industry averages based on data from Phocuswright, Skift Research, the HSMAI Foundation, and published hotel company disclosures:

**Online Travel Agencies (OTAs)**
- Commission rates: 15–30% of room revenue (Skift Research, 2025)
- Average for branded hotels: ~13.5% (Skift Research, 2024)
- Average for independent hotels: ~17.5% (Skift Research, 2024)
- Premium placement and advertising programs can push effective rates higher
- No guest data ownership; limited ability to market to the guest post-stay

**Global Distribution Systems (GDS)**
- Transaction fees: $4–$12 per reservation
- Travel agent commission: 8–10% (often paid by the hotel)
- Total effective cost: 12–18% of room revenue
- Primarily reaches corporate and managed travel segments
- Higher ADR bookings can offset the cost structure

**Metasearch (Google Hotel Ads, Trivago, Kayak)**
- Cost-per-click (CPC) model: $0.50–$3.00+ per click
- Commission-per-acquisition (CPA) model: 10–15%
- Costs vary significantly by market, season, and competitive intensity
- Drives traffic to hotel website (direct booking) or OTA
- Increasingly dominated by Google Hotel Ads

**Brand.com / Hotel Website (Direct Digital)**
- Booking engine fees: 2–4% of revenue
- Payment processing: 2–3%
- Digital marketing costs (SEM, SEO, social, display): variable, typically 3–8% when amortized across direct bookings
- Total effective cost: 7–15% of room revenue
- Full guest data ownership; ability to build ongoing relationship

**Loyalty Program Direct**
- Loyalty program costs (points, elite benefits, operational costs): 3–6% of revenue
- Booking engine and payment processing: 4–7%
- Total effective cost: 7–13% of revenue
- Highest retention rates and ancillary spend
- Lowest marginal acquisition cost for return visits

**Voice / Call Center**
- Staffing and technology costs per reservation: $5–$15
- Effective cost: 3–8% of room revenue
- Declining volume but high conversion rates
- Common for complex bookings, group inquiries, and loyalty elite members

**Walk-In**
- Minimal direct acquisition cost
- Effective cost: 1–3% (front desk labor allocation)
- Lowest volume; unpredictable; often lower rate acceptance

### Understanding Hotel Fee Structures: A Marriott Case Study

For asset-light hotel companies, fee revenue is the primary income stream, and its structure reveals how distribution costs ultimately flow through the system. Marriott, the world's largest asset-light hotel company, generates revenue from three fee categories (Agarwal, 2025f):

- **Franchise fees**: An initial application fee ($50,000–$75,000 or $300–$500 per room), plus ongoing monthly royalty fees of approximately **5–6% of room revenues**, plus program fees covering marketing, technology, reservation systems, distribution, loyalty, and quality assurance. Total franchise costs average close to **11% of room revenue** (Agarwal, 2025f).
- **Base management fees**: For managed (as opposed to franchised) properties, a fee of **2–4% of gross revenue**, similar in structure to a franchise fee.
- **Incentive management fees**: A percentage of **gross operating profits**, typically **10–30%**, designed to align the brand manager's incentives with the owner's profitability. These fees are far more cyclical than franchise or base fees — in H1 2025, Marriott's incentive management fees showed **0% growth** compared to H1 2024, while franchise fees grew 7%, signaling emerging softness in underlying hotel-level profitability (Agarwal, 2025f).

This fee structure matters for distribution analysis because it demonstrates that hotel-level costs extend well beyond OTA commissions. A branded hotel paying 11% in franchise costs, 3% in loyalty program expenses, and 2–4% in booking engine and payment processing fees may find its "direct" channel costs approaching OTA commission levels — a nuance the HSMAI advisory board discussion flagged as frequently overlooked.

### The Hidden Costs

The numbers above capture direct, transactable costs — but the true cost of distribution extends further:

- **Rate parity obligations**: Many OTA contracts require hotels to offer rates on the OTA that are equal to or no higher than rates on the hotel's own website, limiting the hotel's ability to incentivize direct bookings through pricing alone. While rate parity regulations have been loosened in Europe (following antitrust actions against Booking.com and Expedia in France, Germany, Austria, and other markets), they remain prevalent in North America and many other regions (European Commission, 2017). A comprehensive legal analysis by Bianchi and Chen (2024) traces the origin and evolution of rate parity clauses, arguing that they challenge fundamental pillars of competition law in both Europe and the United States. Kathuria and Mackenrodt (2021) go further, arguing that even "narrow" parity clauses — which only prohibit hotels from offering lower rates on their own websites — still meaningfully restrain competition.
- **Promotional participation**: OTAs frequently encourage hotels to participate in flash sales, mobile-only discounts, and "genius" or "member" pricing programs that further discount the room rate, compressing margins.
- **Content and connectivity costs**: Maintaining accurate, compelling listings across dozens of distribution channels requires investment in channel manager technology, content management, and photography.
- **Opportunity cost of displaced direct bookings**: When a guest who would have booked directly instead books through an OTA — a phenomenon known as "channel shift" — the hotel pays a commission for a booking it might have captured at a fraction of the cost.


## 3.4 Net RevPAR: The Metric That Matters

### Defining Net RevPAR

Net RevPAR (sometimes written as NRevPAR or Net Revenue Per Available Room) adjusts traditional RevPAR by subtracting distribution costs. Remy, Boo, and Tee (2023) conducted an exploratory study on the potential of NRevPAR and RevPAC (Revenue Per Available Customer) as next-generation hotel revenue management metrics, arguing that traditional RevPAR fails to capture the true profitability implications of channel choice and distribution costs:

> **Net RevPAR = (Total Room Revenue − Total Distribution Costs) ÷ Total Available Rooms**

Alternatively, it can be calculated at the booking level:

> **Net RevPAR Contribution per Booking = Room Revenue − Distribution Cost of That Booking**

This metric provides a clearer picture of the actual revenue a hotel retains from each room sold. Two hotels with identical RevPAR can have dramatically different profitability profiles depending on their channel mix.

### A Net RevPAR Comparison

Consider two hypothetical 200-room hotels in the same market, both achieving a RevPAR of $150:

At 70% occupancy: **RevPAR = $105 | Net RevPAR ≈ $94**

Hotel Beta actually has a *lower* gross RevPAR — by $2 — but retains $4 more per available room after distribution costs. Over 200 rooms and 365 days, that $4 difference equals approximately **$292,000 in additional annual profit** flowing to the bottom line. And this calculation only accounts for room revenue; the ancillary revenue differences between direct-booked and OTA-booked guests would widen the gap further.

## 3.5 Guest Segmentation: Understanding Who Books and Why

### The Major Segments

Effective distribution strategy requires understanding the distinct guest segments that make up a hotel's demand, because different segments book through different channels, have different price sensitivities, and generate different levels of total value.

**Business Transient**
- Typically books through GDS (via corporate travel management), brand.com, or direct call
- Higher ADR; less price-sensitive; values consistency, location, and loyalty status
- High ancillary potential (extended stays, room service, laundry, meeting rooms)
- Often covered by negotiated corporate rates
- High repeat frequency; strong CLV when retained in loyalty program

**Leisure Transient**
- Most diverse booking behavior; heavy OTA and metasearch usage
- Price-sensitive; highly influenced by reviews, photos, and promotional offers
- Variable ancillary spend; depends heavily on trip purpose and property amenities
- Lower repeat frequency at individual properties; higher brand-level loyalty potential
- Fastest-growing segment in post-pandemic recovery (Skift Research, 2024)

**Group and Meeting**
- Books through direct sales team, RFP process, or third-party meeting planners
- Typically at negotiated group rates (often 10–20% below BAR)
- High ancillary revenue: F&B minimums, audiovisual, room rental, banquet spend
- Lower distribution cost per room night (direct relationship)
- Fills base-level demand; critical for large and convention hotels

**Wholesale and Package**
- Books through bed banks, tour operators, and package bundlers
- Net rates provided to wholesalers; final retail price is marked up by intermediary
- Hotel has limited visibility into final selling price and guest profile
- Lowest net room revenue per night; useful for filling distressed inventory
- Minimal ancillary revenue and almost no guest data capture

**Loyalty Program Members**
- A cross-cutting segment that overlaps with business and leisure transient
- Books predominantly through direct channels (brand.com, app, voice)
- Highest retention rates, highest ancillary spend, lowest marginal acquisition cost
- Represents the hotel's most valuable long-term relationships
- Marriott Bonvoy, Hilton Honors, IHG One Rewards, and World of Hyatt collectively claim over 700 million enrolled members globally, though active membership rates are significantly lower (Skift Research, 2023)

### Segmentation and Channel Strategy

The strategic implication is clear: hotels should not simply try to minimize OTA usage across the board. Instead, they should use segmentation to make channel investments that align with value. OTAs may be the right channel for reaching first-time leisure travelers in unfamiliar markets — if the hotel has a strategy to convert those guests into direct-booking loyalists on their second stay. GDS investment makes sense when a property's demand profile includes significant corporate travel. And direct digital investment pays the highest dividends when paired with a loyalty program that incentivizes return visits.

The goal is not channel elimination but **channel optimization** — deploying each channel for the segment and purpose where it generates the highest net value.


## 3.6 The Billboard Effect: Myth, Reality, or Something in Between?

### The Original Research

In 2009, Professor Chris Anderson of Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration published a study that introduced the concept of the "billboard effect." The research examined what happened to a hotel's direct bookings when it was listed on Expedia. Anderson found that hotels experienced a significant increase in bookings through their own websites — an increase of 7.5–26% — during periods when they were listed on the OTA compared to periods when they were not (Anderson, 2009).

The hypothesis was intuitive: OTAs serve as massive billboards. Millions of travelers browse OTA platforms during the exploration phase of their booking journey, discover hotels they might not have found otherwise, and then navigate to the hotel's own website to book directly — often to check for better rates, earn loyalty points, or access additional information. In this view, the commission paid to the OTA is not just the cost of the OTA booking itself but also a marketing investment that generates spillover demand into lower-cost direct channels.

### The Follow-Up and Supporting Evidence

Anderson conducted a follow-up study in 2011 with expanded methodology and confirmed the billboard effect, though with some important nuances. The effect was strongest for independent hotels and smaller brands that lacked broad name recognition — properties that benefited most from the OTA's marketing reach and search engine dominance (Anderson, 2011).

Additional industry evidence supported the concept:
- Expedia's own research claimed that for every booking made through its platform, hotels received 2.5 additional "look-to-book" visits to their own websites (Expedia Group, 2017).
- A 2017 Phocuswright study found that 75% of U.S. travelers who booked directly with a hotel had visited an OTA at some point during their shopping process (Phocuswright, 2017).
- Google's travel research consistently showed that travelers visit an average of 38 websites before making a hotel booking, with OTAs figuring prominently in the consideration phase (Google, 2014).

### The Counterarguments

The billboard effect has also drawn significant criticism and skepticism:

**Channel Shift Concerns**: Critics argue that a substantial portion of the "incremental" direct bookings attributed to the billboard effect would have occurred anyway. Many travelers who discover a hotel on an OTA and then book on the hotel website were already predisposed to book that hotel — or would have found it through organic search, metasearch, or word of mouth. The OTA may not be creating new demand so much as inserting itself into an existing path to purchase, effectively taxing bookings that were already coming (Toh et al., 2011).

**The Reverse Billboard Effect**: Some researchers and industry practitioners have observed that the billboard effect can work in the opposite direction. A guest who visits the hotel's website first may end up booking through an OTA — because the OTA offers a more seamless user experience, a bundled package, or because the guest trusts the OTA's cancellation policies more. In this scenario, the hotel's own marketing investment drives a booking that generates an OTA commission. The authors' experience across hotel operations suggests this pattern is not uncommon, though formal academic research on the reverse billboard effect remains limited.

**Diminishing Returns at Scale**: The billboard effect appears to be most significant for hotels that lack strong brand recognition. For major brands like Marriott and Hilton — which invest hundreds of millions in their own digital marketing, loyalty programs, and search engine presence — the incremental awareness generated by OTA listings may be marginal relative to the commission cost (Ling et al., 2015).

**Measurement Challenges**: Definitively measuring the billboard effect requires controlling for numerous confounding variables — seasonality, market conditions, competitive dynamics, simultaneous marketing campaigns, and changes in consumer behavior. The original Cornell studies acknowledged these limitations, and subsequent attempts to replicate the findings have produced mixed results.

### Where the Debate Stands

The most balanced view — and the one supported by the preponderance of evidence — is that the billboard effect is **real but variable**. It is strongest for:
- Independent and soft-brand hotels with limited marketing budgets
- Properties in highly competitive urban and resort markets
- Leisure-oriented hotels targeting first-time visitors

It is weakest for:
- Major branded hotels with established loyalty programs and strong digital presence
- Properties in markets where the hotel is already well-known
- Repeat-visit scenarios where the guest already has a direct relationship

The strategic takeaway is not whether OTAs provide a billboard effect, but whether the *cost* of that effect — in the form of commissions — represents a good return on investment compared to alternative marketing expenditures that could drive awareness and direct bookings without the ongoing commission obligation.


## 3.7 The Attribution Challenge

### The Multi-Touchpoint Problem

In a world where a single guest may interact with a dozen or more touchpoints before making a reservation — an Instagram ad, a Google search, a TripAdvisor review, an OTA listing, a metasearch comparison, and finally a brand.com booking — the question of *which channel deserves credit for the booking* is fiendishly complex.

This is the attribution problem, and it has profound implications for how hotels allocate their distribution and marketing budgets.

### Common Attribution Models

**Last-Click Attribution**: Credits the final touchpoint before booking. This is the simplest and most common model, but it systematically overvalues the booking channel (usually brand.com or the OTA) and undervalues all the upstream touchpoints that drove awareness and consideration.

**First-Click Attribution**: Credits the first touchpoint in the guest's journey. This model captures the importance of initial awareness but ignores the role of subsequent interactions in converting interest into a booking.

**Linear Attribution**: Distributes credit equally across all touchpoints. More balanced, but it treats a casual social media impression the same as a high-intent price comparison on metasearch.

**Time-Decay Attribution**: Gives more credit to touchpoints closer to the booking, on the logic that more recent interactions had more influence on the final decision.

**Data-Driven / Algorithmic Attribution**: Uses machine learning to analyze patterns across thousands of booking journeys and assign credit based on each touchpoint's statistical contribution to conversion. This is the gold standard but requires significant data infrastructure and analytical capability.

### Why Attribution Matters for Distribution

If a hotel uses last-click attribution, it might conclude that its brand.com generates 35% of bookings and decide to reduce investment in the "underperforming" social media and metasearch channels that actually drove the awareness and consideration that led to those direct bookings. Conversely, a hotel that relies on last-click attribution might overinvest in OTAs, not realizing that many OTA bookings are channel-shifted from guests who were already aware of the property.

The hotel companies that are most sophisticated about distribution — the Marriotts, Hiltons, and Hyatts of the world — invest heavily in multi-touch attribution models and customer data platforms (CDPs) that stitch together guest interactions across channels and devices. For independent hotels and smaller brands, simpler approaches — such as post-booking surveys asking guests "how did you hear about us?" or analyzing booking patterns when specific channels are activated or deactivated — can provide directional insight.


## 3.8 Ancillary Revenue: The Channel-Dependent Multiplier

### Beyond the Room Rate

Room revenue is the foundation of hotel economics, but it is not the whole picture. Ancillary revenue — from food and beverage outlets, spa and wellness services, parking, resort fees, event space, retail shops, and other amenities — can represent 30–50% or more of a hotel's total revenue, particularly at full-service and resort properties (STR, 2023).

What many hoteliers fail to fully appreciate is how dramatically **the distribution channel influences ancillary spend.**

### The Data on Channel and Spend

Research from multiple sources consistently shows that direct-booked guests and loyalty members spend significantly more on ancillary services than OTA-booked guests:

- Hotel companies consistently report that guests who book directly spend more on food and beverage during their stays than guests who book through third-party channels, a pattern driven by pre-arrival marketing, loyalty engagement, and stronger on-property connection.
- Hotel companies have reported that loyalty program members spend 40–60% more on property during their stays than non-members (Marriott International, 2024; Hilton Worldwide, 2023).
- Skift Research (2023) found that the total revenue per guest — including ancillary spend — was highest among guests who booked through loyalty programs and lowest among guests who booked through wholesale channels.

### Why the Disparity?

Several factors explain the ancillary revenue gap:

1. **Pre-arrival engagement**: Hotels can only market ancillary services before arrival if they have the guest's contact information. Direct bookings and loyalty memberships provide email addresses and app connectivity, enabling pre-arrival emails promoting spa packages, dining reservations, and experience upgrades. OTA bookings typically mask the guest's email, leaving the hotel with no pre-arrival marketing channel.

2. **Guest intent and trip purpose**: Guests who invest the time to book directly — particularly loyalty members who have chosen to build a relationship with the brand — tend to be more engaged with the property and more inclined to utilize its amenities. They view the hotel as the experience, not just a place to sleep.

3. **Personalization**: When a hotel knows a guest's history, preferences, and loyalty tier, it can make personalized ancillary offers — a favorite wine waiting in the room, a targeted spa promotion, a dining credit for a milestone stay. This personalization drives incremental spend that is impossible without guest data ownership.

4. **Length of stay**: Direct-booked and loyalty guests tend to stay slightly longer on average, increasing the window for ancillary purchases.

### Implications for Distribution Strategy

These findings mean that **the total revenue impact of a distribution channel extends far beyond the room rate and commission calculation.** A hotel that captures 40% of bookings through direct channels may be generating 55% or more of its total guest-generated revenue from those channels when ancillary spend is included. This makes the investment in direct channel optimization — website UX, loyalty programs, CRM systems, and email marketing — even more compelling when evaluated on a total-revenue basis.


## 3.9 The Data Advantage of Direct

### Owning the Guest Relationship

Perhaps the most strategically significant difference between direct and indirect distribution channels is **data ownership.** When a guest books directly, the hotel captures:

- Full name and contact information (email, phone)
- Payment information
- Stay history and preferences
- Communication opt-ins
- Loyalty program membership and tier
- Booking behavior patterns (lead time, rate sensitivity, room type preference)
- On-property behavior (F&B spend, amenity usage, service requests)

When a guest books through an OTA, the hotel typically receives:
- Guest name
- A masked or OTA-controlled email address (e.g., guest@guest.booking.com)
- Arrival/departure dates and room type
- A virtual credit card for payment

The difference is stark. With direct booking data, the hotel can build a rich guest profile that enables personalized marketing, targeted offers, anticipatory service, and a deepening relationship over time. With OTA booking data, the hotel knows almost nothing about the guest beyond the current reservation — and cannot contact the guest independently after checkout.

### The CRM Flywheel

Hotels that invest in Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems and Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) can transform direct booking data into a compounding advantage:

1. **Capture**: Guest data from direct bookings flows into the CRM
2. **Enrich**: Each subsequent interaction — stays, dining, spa visits, email engagement, app activity — adds to the guest profile
3. **Activate**: The enriched profile enables personalized marketing, dynamic pricing, and anticipatory service
4. **Convert**: Personalization drives higher conversion rates, increased ancillary spend, and stronger loyalty
5. **Retain**: Loyal guests book direct on return visits, feeding more data into the system

This flywheel — where each direct booking makes the next direct booking more likely and more valuable — is one of the most powerful competitive dynamics in hotel distribution. It explains why major hotel companies are willing to invest billions in loyalty programs, mobile apps, and CRM technology: they are building data assets that compound in value over time.

### The Privacy Landscape

The data advantage of direct bookings is becoming even more important as the digital advertising landscape shifts toward greater privacy protection. The deprecation of third-party cookies, the implementation of Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework, and evolving regulations like GDPR and CCPA are making it increasingly difficult and expensive to target potential guests through paid digital advertising. First-party data — the data a hotel collects directly from its own guests through its own channels — is becoming the most valuable and durable marketing asset a hotel can possess (Skift Research, 2023).


## 3.10 Guest Acquisition vs. Retention Economics

### The Classic Ratio

It is a well-established principle in marketing that acquiring a new customer costs significantly more than retaining an existing one. Industry estimates suggest that acquisition costs **5–25 times** more than retention, a range cited in sources from Harvard Business Review to Skift's analysis of hotel loyalty economics (Skift Research, 2025). While the original research by Reichheld and Sasser (1990) demonstrated that even small improvements in customer retention rates (as little as 5%) could yield profit increases of 25–85%, the wide range of the multiplier reflects differences across segments, property types, and channel mix.

In the hotel context, the economics are even more pronounced:

- **Acquiring a new guest via OTA**: 15–25% of room revenue in commission, plus no guarantee of a return visit
- **Retaining a loyal guest via email**: Less than $1 per marketing touch, with conversion rates of 5–15% for past-guest campaigns (compared to 1–3% for prospecting campaigns)
- **Increasing retention rate by 5%**: Can increase profits by 25–95%, depending on the industry (Reichheld & Sasser, 1990)

### The Retention Funnel

The most effective hotel distribution strategies are designed not just to acquire guests but to move them along a "retention funnel":

1. **Acquire**: Guest discovers and books the hotel (potentially through any channel, including OTAs)
2. **Capture**: Hotel captures guest data during stay (email, preferences, satisfaction feedback)
3. **Engage**: Post-stay outreach — thank you email, satisfaction survey, invitation to join loyalty program
4. **Incentivize**: Targeted offers for a return visit, loyalty program enrollment bonus, direct booking perks
5. **Retain**: Guest books directly on return visit; enters the CRM flywheel described above

In this framework, OTAs have a legitimate role as an **acquisition channel** — a cost-effective way to introduce the hotel to new guests who might not have discovered it otherwise. The key is ensuring that the hotel has systems in place to capture the guest's information during the stay and convert them from an OTA-acquired guest into a direct-booking loyalist. Hotels that use OTAs for acquisition but fail to invest in retention are essentially paying the OTA commission on every stay, forever — an unsustainable economic model.

### The Conversion Imperative

Industry data suggests that the OTA-to-direct conversion rate — the percentage of first-time OTA guests who book directly on their second stay — ranges from 10–30%, depending on the hotel's brand strength, loyalty program attractiveness, and post-stay marketing sophistication (Phocuswright, 2017). More recent proprietary analyses by metasearch providers suggest the range persists, though mobile-first booking behavior may be compressing it (see Chapter 10). Leading hotel companies have made improving this metric a strategic priority, investing in:

- Loyalty program sign-up at check-in and through the hotel app
- Best-rate guarantees for direct bookings
- Exclusive perks for direct bookers (free Wi-Fi, room upgrades, late checkout)
- Targeted post-stay email campaigns with direct booking incentives
- Frictionless booking experiences on brand.com and mobile apps


## 3.11 The Evolution of Hotel Pricing: From Gut Instinct to AI

### The Pricing Revolution

For decades, hotel pricing was as much art as science — revenue managers armed with spreadsheets and intuition, adjusting rates based on competitor moves and gut feel. That era is ending. Across the $340 billion U.S. lodging industry, AI-powered revenue management systems have replaced manual processes with what practitioners now describe as "teams of algorithms" that shift pricing strategies based on market conditions, much like a baseball manager choosing pitchers for specific situations (O'Neill, 2025a).

The shift goes beyond automation. Modern pricing systems optimize across dimensions that spreadsheet-era managers could not: total guest revenue (not just room rate), ancillary spend patterns, competitive positioning, demand signals from airline bookings and event calendars, and — critically for this chapter — the lifetime value of different guest segments booked through different channels. A hotel might price a room lower for a loyalty member booking direct if the system predicts high ancillary spend and future return visits.

### The Technology Gap

This pricing revolution has widened the competitive gap between branded chains and independents. Skift Research's Hotel Tech Benchmark found that while **50% of hotel rooms** are priced using some form of RMS, only **10% of hotels** actually purchase dedicated revenue management software — and much of the "RMS-using" market relies on Expedia's free, limited Rev+ tool rather than a full-stack system (Geerts & Skift Research, 2021). The total RMS market generated just **$260 million** in 2019, against an unused market potential of **$1.34 billion** — one of the largest growth opportunities in hotel technology (Geerts & Skift Research, 2021). Major brands have invested heavily in proprietary revenue management platforms, while fewer than 10% of independent properties use advanced pricing technology (O'Neill, 2025a). The result: independents compete against algorithm-driven pricing with manual approaches, often leaving significant revenue on the table. A growing ecosystem of technology providers — including cloud-based RMS platforms like Atomize (now part of Mews) and Duetto — is working to close this gap by offering enterprise-grade pricing tools at independent-hotel price points.

### Regulatory Scrutiny

The rapid adoption of algorithmic pricing has drawn regulatory attention. Several U.S. states have introduced legislation targeting AI-driven pricing systems that critics argue could enable coordinated pricing behavior or discriminatory practices. The hotel industry maintains that dynamic pricing benefits consumers by optimizing inventory allocation. Regardless of where the regulatory debate lands, it underscores a broader truth: pricing has become a technology-driven, data-intensive discipline — and its intersection with distribution strategy and guest value is the subject of Chapter 5.


## Industry Spotlight: How Hilton's "Stop Clicking Around" Campaign Redefined Distribution Strategy

In January 2016, Hilton Worldwide launched one of the most aggressive direct-booking campaigns in hotel industry history. The "Stop Clicking Around" campaign, backed by a marketing investment exceeding $100 million, carried a provocative message: stop wasting time on OTAs and book directly with Hilton for a guaranteed lowest price and exclusive benefits.

The campaign introduced the **Hilton Price Match Guarantee**, promising that members of Hilton Honors (the company's loyalty program) would always find the lowest room rate on Hilton's direct channels. It also offered exclusive perks available only to direct bookers: free Wi-Fi, digital check-in and room selection, and the ability to earn and redeem Hilton Honors points.

The strategic intent was unmistakable. Hilton was not merely running an advertising campaign; it was attempting to fundamentally shift guest behavior away from OTA dependency and toward direct engagement. The company's then-CEO, Christopher Nassetta, framed it explicitly as a distribution cost issue, telling investors that even a small shift in channel mix from indirect to direct channels could generate hundreds of millions in savings (Nassetta, 2016).

**The results were significant:**
- Hilton Honors membership grew from approximately 50 million to over 60 million members within the first year of the campaign.
- Direct bookings as a percentage of total room nights increased measurably, with Hilton reporting that direct channels accounted for more than 30% of system-wide room nights.
- By 2024, Hilton Honors had grown to over 190 million members, and the company reported that approximately 60% of occupancy came from Honors members booking through direct channels.
- The campaign catalyzed similar "book direct" initiatives across the industry. Marriott launched "It Pays to Book Direct" in 2017, IHG introduced "Your Rate" for IHG Rewards Club members, and Hyatt offered exclusive benefits for World of Hyatt members booking directly.

The Hilton case illustrates several of the chapter's core themes: the economic advantage of direct distribution, the strategic role of loyalty programs as CLV engines, and the willingness of major hotel companies to invest significant capital in shifting distribution mix because they understand the long-term value of owning the guest relationship.

**Discussion Prompt**: Hilton's campaign explicitly positioned OTAs as the problem. Do you think this adversarial framing was strategically sound? What are the risks of antagonizing distribution partners that still deliver a significant share of bookings? How might an independent hotel — without Hilton's brand recognition or loyalty program scale — achieve a similar shift toward direct bookings?


## Chapter Summary

This chapter established that the value of a hotel guest extends far beyond the nightly room rate. By examining Customer Lifetime Value, Net RevPAR, the true cost of acquisition across channels, the billboard effect debate, and the critical role of guest data ownership, we demonstrated why distribution strategy must be evaluated on total guest economics — not top-line revenue alone. Direct-booked, loyal guests generate dramatically higher lifetime value through lower acquisition costs, greater ancillary spend, and compounding data advantages that fuel the CRM flywheel.

**What's Next:** Armed with an understanding of guest value and channel economics, we turn in **Chapter 4: Direct Bookings — Digital Direct** to the strategies, technologies, and campaigns that hotels deploy to win bookings on their own terms — from brand.com optimization and loyalty programs to the direct booking wars that reshaped the industry.


## Key Terms

**Ancillary Revenue** — Non-room revenue generated by a hotel guest, including food and beverage, spa, parking, resort fees, event space, and other on-property spending.

**Attribution** — The process of determining which marketing or distribution touchpoints deserve credit for generating a booking or conversion.

**Billboard Effect** — The hypothesis that a hotel's listing on an OTA generates incremental awareness and traffic to the hotel's own website, resulting in direct bookings that would not have occurred without the OTA listing.

**Channel Mix** — The proportion of a hotel's total bookings generated through each distribution channel (e.g., OTA, GDS, brand.com, voice, loyalty).

**Channel Shift** — The phenomenon in which a guest who would have booked through a lower-cost channel instead books through a higher-cost channel, resulting in unnecessary commission or acquisition costs.

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** — A projection of the total net revenue a hotel can expect from a single guest over the entire duration of their relationship, including room revenue, ancillary spend, and accounting for acquisition and retention costs.

**CRM Flywheel** — A self-reinforcing cycle in which guest data captured from direct bookings enables personalized marketing and service, which drives higher loyalty and more direct bookings, generating still more data.

**Net RevPAR** — Revenue Per Available Room adjusted for distribution costs; calculated as (Total Room Revenue − Total Distribution Costs) ÷ Total Available Rooms.

**OTA Commission** — The fee paid by a hotel to an online travel agency for each booking generated through the OTA's platform, typically expressed as a percentage of room revenue (15–25%).

**Rate Parity** — A contractual obligation requiring a hotel to offer rates on an OTA that are equal to or no higher than rates available on the hotel's own website.

**Retention Rate** — The percentage of guests who return to stay at a hotel or within a brand's portfolio within a defined period.


## Discussion Questions

1. **The CLV Calculation**: Using the CLV framework presented in this chapter, estimate the five-year lifetime value of a typical guest at a hotel you are familiar with. What assumptions did you make, and how sensitive is the calculation to changes in retention rate and visit frequency?

2. **The Billboard Effect Debate**: A 150-room independent boutique hotel in Miami Beach is considering delisting from Expedia to save on commission costs. The hotel's marketing manager argues that the billboard effect makes the OTA listing worthwhile even if it is expensive. The hotel's owner believes the commissions are eating into profits. Who do you agree with, and what data would you want to see before making this decision?

3. **Net RevPAR in Practice**: You are the revenue manager for a 300-room urban hotel. Your GM has asked you to increase RevPAR by 5% next quarter. You can achieve this by increasing OTA allocation (which would raise occupancy and ADR through higher-rated OTA bookings) or by investing in direct channel marketing (which has a longer payback period but lower distribution costs). Which approach do you recommend, and how would you frame the decision using Net RevPAR?

4. **The Data Divide**: "Hotels that do not own their guest data are renting their future." Discuss this statement in the context of the shift toward first-party data, the deprecation of third-party cookies, and the competitive dynamics between hotel companies and OTA platforms.

5. **Acquisition to Retention**: Design a step-by-step strategy for converting an OTA-acquired guest into a direct-booking loyalty member. What specific touchpoints would you create before, during, and after the stay? What metrics would you track to measure success?
