## Opening Vignette

In the spring of 2020, as COVID-19 shuttered hotels across the globe, Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel faced an existential reckoning. The Amsterdam-based travel giant—parent of Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Kayak, and OpenTable—saw gross travel bookings plummet 91% in April 2020 compared to the prior year (Booking Holdings, 2020). Virtually overnight, the company that had processed over $96 billion in travel bookings in 2019 watched its pipeline evaporate. Fogel laid off thousands, drew down credit lines, and prepared for a recovery whose timeline nobody could predict.

Yet by 2023, Booking Holdings reported record gross travel bookings of $150.6 billion—exceeding pre-pandemic levels by more than 50% (Booking Holdings, 2024a). Its market capitalization surpassed $130 billion, making it one of the most valuable travel companies on earth. The rebound was not accidental. Booking.com had spent two decades building a distribution machine of staggering scale: 28 million listings across 43 languages, a marketing spend exceeding $6 billion annually, and an algorithm-driven marketplace that connected hotels with travelers more efficiently than any individual property could achieve on its own.

For hotel operators, the story of OTAs is one of profound ambivalence. These platforms deliver guests that properties could never reach independently—yet they extract commissions of 15% to 25% for the privilege, control the customer relationship, and increasingly set the terms of engagement. Understanding how OTAs rose to dominance, how their business models work, and how to manage these relationships strategically is among the most consequential skills in modern hospitality management.

## 8.1 The OTA Origin Story

### The Birth of Online Travel

The story of online travel agencies begins in 1996, a year that fundamentally altered how human beings plan and purchase travel. Two companies launched within months of each other, each backed by technology giants, each convinced that the internet would disintermediate the $400 billion global travel industry.

**Expedia** emerged from Microsoft's interactive media division. In October 1996, Microsoft launched Expedia.com as an online travel agency, initially leveraging data from the Worldspan GDS to offer airline tickets, hotel rooms, and rental cars through a single consumer-facing website (May, 2021). The vision was audacious: replace the neighborhood travel agent with a website that could search, compare, and book travel products in minutes rather than hours. Rich Barton, Expedia's founding CEO, understood that the internet's power lay in information asymmetry reduction—giving consumers access to pricing and inventory data that had previously been locked inside GDS terminals accessible only to licensed travel agents.

**Travelocity**, backed by Sabre Holdings (the GDS operator), launched in the same year with a similar premise but from a different strategic position. Where Expedia was a technology company entering travel, Travelocity was a travel technology company entering e-commerce. The distinction would matter less than either company imagined; both proved that consumers were eager to research and book travel online.

Meanwhile, in a Connecticut garage, a young entrepreneur named Jay Walker was developing an idea that would reshape hotel distribution in ways nobody anticipated. In 1997, Walker launched **Priceline.com** with its patented "Name Your Own Price" model—an opaque booking system that allowed consumers to bid on hotel rooms without knowing which property they would receive until after purchase (Walker, 1999). The model was ingenious for hotels: it enabled them to sell distressed inventory at steep discounts without publicly advertising low rates that might undermine their brand positioning. Research by Xie, Anderson, and Verma (2017), published in the *Cornell Hospitality Quarterly*, later confirmed that customer preferences and willingness to pay differed significantly between opaque and transparent booking channels, validating the strategic rationale behind opaque pricing. Priceline went public in March 1999 at $16 per share and closed its first day of trading at $69, giving the company a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion—a staggering valuation for a company with minimal revenue (Hansell, 1999).

### Booking.com: The European Revolution

While American OTAs battled for dominance in the U.S. market, a quieter revolution was unfolding in the Netherlands. In 1996, Geert-Jan Bruinsma founded Bookings.nl, a small Dutch startup that listed Amsterdam hotels on the internet. The company's early insight was deceptively simple: European hotels were overwhelmingly independent and family-owned, lacking the centralized reservation systems and brand websites that American chains possessed. These properties desperately needed online distribution but had neither the technology nor the expertise to build it themselves.

Bookings.nl (later renamed Booking.com) developed an **agency model** that was radically different from the merchant model favored by Expedia and Travelocity. Rather than purchasing inventory at wholesale rates and reselling it with a markup—the merchant approach—Booking.com simply listed the hotel's rooms at the hotel's own prices and collected a commission only when a guest actually stayed (Schaal, 2018). The hotel set its own rates, managed its own inventory, and collected payment directly from the guest. Booking.com's commission was its fee for delivering the customer.

This distinction proved transformative. The agency model eliminated financial risk for hotels (no prepayment meant no chargebacks if guests didn't show), preserved rate integrity (the price on Booking.com was the hotel's own price), and was irresistibly easy to adopt—particularly for small, independent European properties that lacked sophisticated revenue management capabilities. By the early 2000s, Booking.com had signed up tens of thousands of European hotels, building an inventory breadth that no competitor could match.

In 2005, Priceline Group acquired Booking.com for approximately $133 million—a price that, in retrospect, represents one of the greatest bargains in internet history (Priceline Group, 2005). Under Priceline's ownership and the leadership of CEO Jeffery Boyd and later Glenn Fogel, Booking.com received massive investment in technology and marketing. The company's growth was explosive: by 2012, Booking.com had become the largest online accommodation platform in the world by room nights sold, surpassing even Expedia (Schaal, 2012).

### How They Won

The OTA victors—Booking.com and Expedia—won through a combination of factors that created formidable competitive moats:

1. **Network Effects.** More hotel listings attracted more consumers, which attracted more hotels. This virtuous cycle created a marketplace that became increasingly difficult to replicate.

2. **Marketing Scale.** OTAs invested billions in search engine marketing (SEM), becoming Google's largest advertising customers. In 2023, Booking Holdings alone spent $6.2 billion on performance marketing, primarily Google Ads (Booking Holdings, 2024a). No individual hotel—or even hotel chain—could match this spending.

3. **Technology Investment.** OTAs built sophisticated platforms for search, comparison, booking, payment processing, customer service, and review management. Their technology teams numbered in the thousands.

4. **Data Advantages.** Processing hundreds of millions of searches and bookings annually gave OTAs unparalleled insight into consumer behavior, pricing sensitivity, and demand patterns.

5. **Global Reach.** OTAs operated in dozens of languages and currencies, connecting a hotel in Bangkok with a traveler in Brazil—a feat that would be prohibitively expensive for individual properties.

As Carroll and Sileo (2014) argued in their PhocusWright study *Online Travel Agencies: More Than a Distribution Channel*, OTAs had evolved far beyond simple booking intermediaries — they had become powerful marketing engines, demand generators, and data platforms that fundamentally reshaped how consumers discover and evaluate hotels. Carroll, who pioneered the academic study of hospitality distribution at Cornell, noted that hotels needed to view OTAs not merely as a cost center but as part of a broader strategic ecosystem.

## 8.2 OTA Business Models: Agency, Merchant, and Hybrid

Understanding how OTAs make money is essential for any hospitality professional managing distribution strategy. Three primary business models have evolved since the late 1990s, each with distinct implications for hotels.

### The Merchant Model

Under the merchant model, the OTA contracts with the hotel for rooms at a **net rate**—a wholesale price that is typically 20–40% below the hotel's published retail rate. The OTA then sets the consumer-facing price, keeps the markup as its revenue, and collects payment directly from the guest at the time of booking. The hotel receives payment from the OTA, usually after the guest's stay, at the predetermined net rate.

**How it works in practice:**
- Hotel provides a net rate of $120 per night to the OTA
- OTA sells the room to the consumer at $160
- OTA retains the $40 difference (25% margin)
- Guest pays the OTA at booking; hotel is paid by the OTA post-stay

This model was pioneered by Expedia in the early 2000s and became the dominant approach in the U.S. market through the mid-2010s. Its advantages for OTAs were significant: the markup was often opaque to the hotel, the OTA controlled pricing, and prepayment reduced cancellation risk. For hotels, the merchant model provided guaranteed revenue and simplified accounting—but at the cost of pricing control and rate transparency.

The merchant model created significant tension in the industry. Hotels complained that OTAs were reselling rooms at prices that undercut the hotel's own direct rates, creating consumer confusion and eroding brand value (Toh et al., 2011). The question of who "owns" the price—the hotel or the distributor—became a central battleground.

### The Agency Model

The agency model, championed by Booking.com, operates on a fundamentally different principle. The hotel sets its own retail price and manages its own inventory. The OTA displays this price to consumers and facilitates the booking, but the **guest pays the hotel directly**—either at check-in or, increasingly, through online payment facilitated by the OTA. The OTA earns a **commission** on the completed stay, typically ranging from 15% to 25% of the room revenue.

**How it works in practice:**
- Hotel lists a room at $160 per night on the OTA
- Guest books and pays the hotel directly (or via OTA-facilitated payment)
- OTA invoices the hotel a 17% commission: $27.20
- Hotel retains $132.80

The agency model preserves the hotel's control over pricing—the rate on the OTA is the hotel's own rate. It also means the hotel collects payment first, improving cash flow. However, the commission percentages can be substantial, and hotels that participate in visibility-boosting programs (such as Booking.com's "Preferred Partner" program) may pay commissions of 20% or higher. Guo, Anderson, Dong, Zhao, and Ji (2020) examined the coordination contracts between hotels and OTAs and found that the standard commission model, while simple, does not always align incentives between hotels and distributors — particularly when OTAs have significant bargaining power over smaller, independent properties.

### The Hybrid Model

By the mid-2010s, the distinction between agency and merchant models began to blur. Expedia expanded its agency offerings, while Booking.com introduced merchant-like payment processing capabilities. Today, most major OTAs operate a **hybrid model** that offers hotels both options—and sometimes combines elements of each within a single platform.

Booking.com's introduction of its **Payments platform** in 2018 was a pivotal development. The platform enabled Booking.com to process guest payments directly, even within its traditional agency framework. By 2023, approximately 40% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through its payments platform (Booking Holdings, 2024a). This shift gave Booking.com greater control over the transaction, enabled it to offer alternative payment methods, and moved its economics closer to a merchant model in practice—even while technically remaining an agency.

Expedia Group, conversely, expanded its agency-model offerings, particularly through its Expedia Partner Solutions (EPS) division—a B2B platform that supplies hotel inventory to third-party travel companies, loyalty programs, and corporate booking tools. EPS operates primarily on an agency basis, with the hotel setting the rate and paying a commission.

For revenue managers, the critical calculation is not the nominal commission rate but the **effective net revenue** per room night from each channel. A 17% agency commission on a $200 rate yields $166 net; a merchant model where the OTA pays a $155 net rate yields $155—even though the merchant model may appear simpler. Understanding these economics at a granular level is essential for optimizing distribution strategy.

## 8.3 The Duopoly: Booking Holdings vs. Expedia Group

### Market Structure

The global OTA landscape is dominated by two holding companies whose combined market share of OTA-intermediated hotel bookings exceeds 65% worldwide (Phocuswright, 2024). Understanding their structure, strategy, and competitive dynamics is essential for any hotel distribution professional.

**Booking Holdings** (NASDAQ: BKNG)

*(Source: Expedia Group, 2024a)*

### Strategic Differences

Despite competing for the same hotel bookings, the two companies have pursued meaningfully different strategies:

**Booking Holdings: The Single-Brand Juggernaut.** Under the leadership of Glenn Fogel, Booking Holdings has increasingly concentrated its consumer-facing strategy around the Booking.com brand. The company's "connected trip" vision aims to transform Booking.com from an accommodation booking platform into a comprehensive travel super-app—one where consumers can book flights, hotels, car rentals, attractions, and restaurant reservations in a single, seamless experience (Fogel, 2023). This strategy leverages Booking.com's massive user base (over 300 million app downloads) and its accumulated behavioral data. Booking.com's dominance is most pronounced in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific, reflecting its origins as a European platform serving independent hotels.

**Expedia Group: The Multi-Brand Platform.** Expedia Group historically operated as a portfolio of distinct brands—Expedia for full-service OTA, Hotels.com for accommodation-focused booking with a loyalty program, Vrbo for vacation rentals, Orbitz and Travelocity for value-conscious travelers, and Hotwire for opaque deals. Under CEO Peter Kern (2020–2023) and subsequently Ariane Gorin, the company embarked on a significant transformation: consolidating its technology infrastructure onto a single platform, unifying its loyalty program under "One Key" (launched 2023), and rationalizing its brand portfolio (Expedia Group, 2024a). Expedia's strength in the North American market—particularly in the corporate and package travel segments—differentiates it from Booking.com's accommodation-first approach.

### The Financial Gap

Perhaps the most striking feature of the duopoly is the widening gap between the two companies. In 2015, Booking Holdings and Expedia Group had roughly comparable market capitalizations. By 2024, Booking Holdings was valued at approximately six times Expedia Group (Macrotrends, 2024). This divergence reflects Booking.com's superior growth in international markets, its higher operating margins, and investor confidence in its single-brand strategy. For hotel operators, the practical implication is clear: Booking.com is increasingly the dominant OTA partner, and managing that relationship effectively has become a critical competency.

## 8.4 Commission Structures and Negotiation

### Standard Commission Rates

OTA commissions represent one of the largest variable costs in hotel operations. Understanding the range and structure of these commissions is essential for financial planning and distribution strategy.

According to the Skift Research *Hotel Distribution Outlook 2024*, average OTA commission rates in 2024 were:
- **Independent hotels (global average):** 17.5%
- **Branded/chain hotels (global average):** 13.5%
- **U.S. market range:** 15–25%, with most falling between 15% and 20%
- **Premium placement programs:** 20–30% (for enhanced visibility)

*(Source: Skift Research, 2024a)*

The disparity between independent and branded hotels reflects bargaining power. Major chains—Marriott, Hilton, IHG, Accor—negotiate group-wide contracts that leverage their collective inventory of hundreds of thousands of rooms. An independent boutique hotel, by contrast, negotiates from a position of relative weakness and may accept higher commission rates to secure visibility on the platform.

### Commission Tiers and Visibility Programs

OTAs have developed sophisticated tiered programs that offer hotels greater visibility in exchange for higher commissions or exclusive terms:

**Booking.com's Preferred Partner Program** offers hotels a badge, improved search ranking, and conversion-enhancing features in exchange for commissions typically 3–5 percentage points above the base rate. Hotels in the program may pay 18–22% commissions but receive measurably higher booking volumes (Booking.com, 2024).

**Expedia's Accelerator Program** allows hotels to temporarily boost their search ranking by increasing their commission rate. The program operates on a sliding scale—the higher the commission, the greater the visibility boost. Revenue managers use this tactically during low-demand periods to drive incremental bookings.

**Genius and Member Deals.** Booking.com's Genius loyalty program offers discounts of 10–20% to frequent bookers. Hotels that participate fund these discounts from their own margins (reducing their net rate) in exchange for access to Booking.com's most loyal and highest-converting customer segment. The economics require careful analysis: a 10% Genius discount on a room already subject to a 17% commission means the hotel nets approximately 75% of the original retail rate—a meaningful reduction.

### Negotiation Strategies

Experienced revenue managers and distribution professionals employ several strategies to manage OTA commission costs:

1. **Volume Leverage.** Hotels or hotel groups that represent significant booking volume to an OTA can negotiate lower base commission rates. A hotel generating 5,000+ room nights annually through a single OTA has meaningful negotiating power.

2. **Selective Participation.** Rather than enrolling in every visibility program, sophisticated operators analyze the incremental revenue versus incremental cost of each tier. A hotel might participate in Booking.com's Preferred Partner program during shoulder seasons but opt out during peak periods when occupancy is assured.

3. **Rate Structure Optimization.** Offering the OTA a curated set of room types and rate plans—rather than full inventory access—can limit commission exposure while maintaining visibility.

4. **Multi-OTA Strategy.** Maintaining active relationships with multiple OTAs creates competitive tension and prevents over-reliance on any single platform. If Booking.com represents 80% of a hotel's OTA bookings, that hotel has limited negotiating leverage.

5. **Contract Review Cadence.** OTA contracts should be reviewed annually, with performance data (conversion rates, cancellation rates, average booking value) analyzed to inform renegotiation.

## 8.5 OTA Ranking Algorithms: How Hotels Get Visibility

### The Black Box

OTA search results are not arranged randomly. Each major OTA employs proprietary **ranking algorithms** that determine which hotels appear first when a consumer searches for accommodation in a given destination. For hotels, understanding these algorithms—even at a general level—is critical, because position in search results directly correlates with booking volume. Research by Expedia (2017) found that hotels appearing in the first page of search results received dramatically more clicks and bookings than those appearing on subsequent pages, a pattern consistent with consumer behavior on any search platform.

### Key Ranking Factors

While OTAs do not publish their exact algorithms, industry research and OTA documentation reveal the primary factors that influence ranking:

1. **Commission Rate / Margin.** Hotels paying higher commissions or offering higher margins generally receive better placement. This is the most commercially significant—and most controversial—ranking factor. OTAs are for-profit companies, and their algorithms naturally favor listings that generate the most revenue per impression.

2. **Conversion Rate.** Hotels that convert a high percentage of page views into bookings are rewarded with better visibility. OTAs want to show consumers listings they are likely to book, because each unconverted impression represents wasted marketing spend. Factors that improve conversion include compelling photography, complete and accurate descriptions, competitive pricing, and strong review scores.

3. **Guest Review Scores.** Review scores are weighted heavily in most OTA algorithms. Booking.com, for example, displays review scores prominently on every listing, and properties with scores above 8.0 (out of 10) typically receive meaningful ranking advantages. The relationship is reinforcing: better reviews lead to better rankings, which lead to more bookings, which lead to more reviews.

4. **Content Completeness.** Hotels that provide comprehensive listing content—high-quality photos, detailed room descriptions, amenity lists, local area information—tend to rank higher. OTAs measure "content score" and use it as a ranking input.

5. **Availability and Pricing Competitiveness.** Hotels that maintain open availability and offer competitive rates relative to their comp set tend to rank better. Closing out dates or offering rates significantly above market reduces ranking position.

6. **Cancellation Policy.** Properties offering more flexible cancellation policies (free cancellation up to 24 hours before arrival, for example) tend to convert at higher rates and therefore rank higher.

7. **Participation in OTA Programs.** Enrollment in Preferred Partner, Genius, or equivalent programs carries explicit ranking benefits.

### Strategic Implications

The algorithmic nature of OTA ranking creates a dynamic where hotels must continuously optimize their OTA listings—much as websites optimize for Google search results. The practice, sometimes called **OTA SEO**, involves:

- Regularly updating photos and descriptions
- Responding promptly and professionally to guest reviews
- Monitoring and adjusting pricing relative to competitors
- Analyzing conversion metrics through OTA extranet dashboards
- Strategically participating in promotional programs during low-demand periods

Hotels that treat their OTA listings as passive directory entries—uploading minimal content and ignoring reviews—will find themselves progressively buried in search results, regardless of the quality of the physical product.

## 8.6 Rate Parity: The Controversial Cornerstone

### What Is Rate Parity?

**Rate parity** refers to the contractual requirement, imposed by OTAs, that hotels maintain consistent pricing across all distribution channels. Under a strict rate parity clause, a hotel cannot offer a lower rate on its own website, through another OTA, or through any other publicly available channel than the rate displayed on the OTA in question.

Rate parity has been one of the most contentious issues in hospitality distribution for over a decade. OTAs argue that parity is essential to maintain consumer trust—if a guest finds a lower rate elsewhere after booking through an OTA, it erodes confidence in the platform. Hotels counter that parity clauses prevent them from incentivizing direct bookings and effectively lock them into paying OTA commissions in perpetuity.

### Types of Rate Parity

The industry distinguishes between two forms of rate parity:

- **Wide Rate Parity:** The hotel must offer the OTA a rate equal to or better than any rate available on any other online channel, including the hotel's own website. This is the most restrictive form.

- **Narrow Rate Parity:** The hotel must offer the OTA a rate equal to or better than any rate available on the hotel's own online channels (website and app), but is free to offer lower rates through other OTAs or offline channels (such as phone or walk-in). This is less restrictive and has become the more common standard in markets where regulators have intervened.

### Global Legal Challenges

Rate parity clauses have faced sustained legal and regulatory challenges worldwide, with outcomes varying dramatically by jurisdiction:

**European Union.** France was the first major market to act, passing the **Loi Macron** in 2015, which banned rate parity clauses entirely—hotels in France are free to offer lower rates on their own websites and through any other channel (République Française, 2015). Austria, Italy, and Belgium followed with similar legislation. Germany's Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) ruled Booking.com's wide rate parity clauses anti-competitive in 2015, and a subsequent court ruling in 2021 upheld the prohibition (Bundeskartellamt, 2015). In 2023, the European Commission launched a broader investigation into OTA practices across the EU.

**United Kingdom.** The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigated OTA rate parity practices and accepted commitments from Booking.com and Expedia to move from wide to narrow parity in 2015 (CMA, 2015).

**Australia.** The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) examined rate parity clauses and ultimately accepted voluntary commitments from major OTAs to adopt narrow parity (ACCC, 2016).

**United States.** The U.S. has taken a largely market-driven approach, with no federal legislation specifically addressing rate parity. However, individual states have occasionally introduced bills, and the overall trend has been toward narrow parity as OTAs voluntarily adjusted their practices in response to global regulatory pressure.

**Asia-Pacific.** Japan, South Korea, and several Southeast Asian markets have investigated or regulated rate parity to varying degrees, generally moving toward narrow parity or outright bans.

### The Current State

As of 2024, the global trend is clearly toward the erosion of wide rate parity. Most major OTAs now operate under narrow parity in the majority of their markets. However, narrow parity still constrains hotels' ability to undercut OTA rates on their own websites—the most commercially significant direct channel. The practical effect is that hotels must find creative ways to drive direct bookings without simply offering a lower public rate: member-only discounts (visible only to logged-in loyalty members), package deals that bundle room with amenities, and closed-user-group rates are all strategies that technically comply with narrow parity while offering direct bookers better value.

## 8.7 The Billboard Effect: OTA Marketing Power

### What Is the Billboard Effect?

The **billboard effect** is a phenomenon first documented by Professor Chris Anderson of Cornell University in a landmark 2009 study. Anderson found that hotels listed on Expedia.com experienced a **7.5–26% increase in bookings through their own website** following their listing, suggesting that OTA presence generates awareness that drives consumers to book directly with the hotel (Anderson, 2009).

The logic is intuitive: a traveler searching for hotels on an OTA discovers a property they like, but rather than booking immediately, they navigate to the hotel's own website—perhaps to find a better rate, access more detailed information, or book through the hotel's loyalty program. The OTA listing acts as a "billboard"—an advertisement that the hotel did not pay for unless a booking actually occurs on the OTA.

### The Debate

The billboard effect has been both celebrated and contested since Anderson's original research:

**Proponents** argue that OTA listings function as a critical marketing channel, particularly for independent hotels that lack the brand recognition and marketing budgets of major chains. A study by Phocuswright (2013) found that 75% of travelers who initially searched on an OTA visited the hotel's direct website before completing their booking. The billboard effect, in this view, means that OTA commissions should be understood partly as marketing costs—the price of awareness.

**Skeptics** counter that the billboard effect may be overstated or declining. Anderson himself published a follow-up study in 2011 with a more nuanced finding, noting that the effect varied significantly by hotel type, market, and competitive conditions (Anderson, 2011). As OTAs have improved their user experience, added loyalty programs, and introduced frictionless mobile booking, the incentive for consumers to leave the OTA and book directly has diminished. Research by Bowen and Whalen (2017) suggested that the billboard effect was weakening as OTAs invested in retention and conversion optimization.

**The practitioner reality** is that the billboard effect likely still exists but its magnitude depends heavily on context. A well-known luxury hotel with a compelling direct booking proposition (member rates, exclusive perks) will capture more billboard-effect bookings than a midscale property with no loyalty program and a poorly designed website. Hotels cannot simply list on OTAs and assume that direct bookings will follow; they must actively invest in their own digital presence to capture the demand that OTAs generate.

## 8.8 Managing OTA Relationships: The Love-Hate Dynamic

### The Fundamental Tension

The relationship between hotels and OTAs is characterized by mutual dependence and mutual resentment—what industry veterans often describe as a "love-hate" dynamic:

**Why Hotels Need OTAs:**
- **Global reach** that no individual hotel can replicate
- **Marketing power** through billions in advertising spend
- **Technology platforms** that deliver seamless booking experiences
- **Access to new customer segments**, particularly international travelers
- **Demand during low-occupancy periods** when direct channels are insufficient

**Why Hotels Resent OTAs:**
- **High commission costs** that erode profitability
- **Loss of customer relationship** data and direct communication
- **Rate parity restrictions** that limit pricing flexibility
- **Ranking algorithms** that favor higher-commission hotels
- **Brand dilution** as hotels become commoditized listings in a vast marketplace
- **Customer loyalty accruing to the OTA** rather than the hotel brand

### Best Practices for OTA Management

Industry experts and experienced revenue managers recommend a balanced, strategic approach:

**1. Treat OTAs as Partners, Not Enemies.** Hotels that view OTAs purely as adversaries miss opportunities for productive collaboration. OTAs invest heavily in market intelligence, consumer insights, and promotional tools that hotels can leverage. A constructive relationship with your OTA market manager can yield insights into competitive positioning, demand forecasts, and promotional opportunities.

**2. Diversify Your OTA Portfolio.** Over-reliance on a single OTA creates vulnerability—both commercially (the OTA has negotiating leverage) and operationally (any change in the OTA's algorithm or terms disproportionately affects your business). Maintain active listings on at least 2–3 major OTAs plus relevant regional platforms.

**3. Invest in Your Direct Channel.** The most effective defense against OTA dominance is a compelling direct booking proposition. Hotels with strong websites, mobile apps, loyalty programs, and member-exclusive rates consistently achieve healthier channel mixes. Every dollar invested in direct channel capability reduces long-term OTA dependence.

**4. Use Data to Inform Channel Strategy.** OTA extranets provide detailed performance data: conversion rates, cancellation rates, average booking value, geographic source of bookings, and competitive benchmarking. Sophisticated operators analyze this data regularly to optimize their OTA strategy—adjusting participation in promotional programs, modifying rate plans, and allocating inventory strategically.

**5. Monitor Rate Integrity.** Ensure that OTA rates accurately reflect your intended pricing. Rate parity violations—whether by the OTA itself or through downstream distribution (e.g., wholesale rates leaking onto OTA platforms)—can undermine your pricing strategy and trigger consumer confusion. Regular rate shopping across channels is essential.

**6. Optimize for the Algorithm.** As discussed in Section 8.5, OTA ranking is algorithmic. Hotels that proactively manage their content, reviews, and conversion metrics will outperform competitors that neglect these factors.

## 8.9 Regional OTAs: Beyond the Duopoly

While Booking Holdings and Expedia Group dominate the global OTA landscape, several regional platforms command significant market share in their home markets and are increasingly expanding internationally.

### Trip.com Group (Formerly Ctrip)

**Headquarters:** Shanghai, China
**Key Brands:** Ctrip, Trip.com, Skyscanner, Qunar, Tongcheng Travel (investment)
**2023 Revenue:** $6.9 billion (Trip.com Group, 2024)

Trip.com Group is the dominant OTA in China—the world's largest domestic travel market—and has aggressively expanded into international markets through the Trip.com brand and its 2016 acquisition of Skyscanner. The company's strength lies in its deep integration with China's digital ecosystem (WeChat, Alipay) and its understanding of Chinese traveler preferences. For hotels seeking to attract Chinese outbound travelers—a segment that reached 87 million trips in 2023, approaching pre-pandemic levels (China Tourism Academy, 2024)—a presence on Ctrip/Trip.com is essential.

### MakeMyTrip

**Headquarters:** Gurugram, India
**Key Brands:** MakeMyTrip, Goibibo, redBus
**2023 Revenue:** $672 million (MakeMyTrip, 2024)

MakeMyTrip dominates India's online travel market, which is one of the fastest-growing in the world. India's outbound travel market is projected to grow from 27 million departures in 2023 to over 50 million by 2030 (CAPA India, 2024), making MakeMyTrip an increasingly important distribution partner for international hotels.

### Despegar

**Headquarters:** Buenos Aires, Argentina (incorporated in British Virgin Islands)
**Key Brands:** Despegar, Decolar (Brazil)
**2023 Revenue:** $602 million (Despegar, 2024)

Despegar is the leading OTA in Latin America, operating across 19 countries with particular strength in Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. The company's advantages include local payment integration (installment plans are critical in Latin American markets), Spanish and Portuguese language optimization, and deep knowledge of regional travel patterns.

### Other Notable Regional Players

- **Yanolja / Interpark Triple** (South Korea): Dominant in South Korean domestic travel; expanding into Southeast Asia through technology partnerships.
- **Traveloka** (Southeast Asia): Leading OTA in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines; strong mobile-first approach.
- **Ozon Travel / Ostrovok** (Russia): Major Russian OTAs that gained share after Western platforms exited the market in 2022.
- **Hoteis.com / Hotel Urbano** (Brazil): Domestic Brazilian platforms with strong local market knowledge.

### Strategic Implications for Hotels

Regional OTAs matter because travel demand is not uniform. A luxury resort in the Maldives may find that 40% of its OTA bookings originate from Ctrip, not Booking.com. A boutique hotel in Mexico City may discover that Despegar delivers a higher average booking value than Expedia. Effective distribution strategy requires understanding where your guests come from—and which platforms they use to book.

## 8.10 OTA Strategies Post-COVID

The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally disrupted the OTA business model and accelerated several strategic shifts that continue to reshape the industry.

### Flexibility as the New Standard

Pre-pandemic, OTAs and hotels alike offered a mix of refundable and non-refundable rates, with non-refundable options typically priced lower. COVID-era cancellation chaos—millions of travelers seeking refunds for non-refundable bookings—forced OTAs to prioritize **flexible cancellation policies**. By 2023, the overwhelming majority of OTA bookings were for refundable rates, and consumers had been conditioned to expect free cancellation as a baseline. This shift has implications for hotels: higher cancellation rates (often 30–40% for OTA bookings) require more aggressive overbooking strategies and more sophisticated demand forecasting (Skift Research, 2024a).

### The "Connected Trip" and Super-App Ambitions

Both Booking Holdings and Expedia Group emerged from the pandemic with strategies to expand beyond accommodation into comprehensive travel platforms — a vision that Carroll, Kwortnik, and Rose (2007) presciently explored in their Cornell Hospitality Report *Travel Packaging: An Internet Frontier*, which examined how online intermediaries were systematically expanding from simple hotel bookings into bundled travel products. Booking.com's "connected trip" initiative seeks to bundle flights, hotels, car rentals, and activities into a single itinerary managed through its app. The goal is to increase customer engagement, capture a larger share of total trip spending, and build loyalty that transcends any single booking. Expedia's "One Key" loyalty program, which allows members to earn and redeem rewards across Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo, pursues similar objectives through a different structural approach (Expedia Group, 2024a).

### AI and Personalization

OTAs are investing heavily in **artificial intelligence** to personalize search results, optimize pricing, and enhance the booking experience. Booking.com launched an AI-powered trip planning assistant in 2023, leveraging large language models to help travelers plan complex itineraries through conversational interfaces (Booking Holdings, 2024b). Expedia introduced similar features through its ChatGPT integration. For hotels, the implication is that OTA recommendations may increasingly be driven by AI algorithms rather than traditional search ranking—adding a new layer of complexity to visibility optimization.

### Alternative Accommodation Competition

The pandemic accelerated consumer adoption of alternative accommodations—vacation rentals, apartments, and private homes—particularly for longer stays and domestic travel. Both major OTA groups have expanded their alternative accommodation listings (Booking.com now lists over 7 million non-hotel properties). For traditional hotels, this means competing for share of wallet not only against other hotels but against an entirely different product category—within the same OTA platform.

### Loyalty and Direct Relationships

Paradoxically, the pandemic also strengthened the case for direct hotel relationships. When travel restrictions created chaos, guests who had booked directly with hotels often received more responsive service—direct communication, flexible rebooking, personalized accommodations—than those who had booked through OTAs and found themselves trapped in customer service queues. This experience reinforced the value of direct booking for both hotels and guests, contributing to the continued growth of brand.com as a distribution channel in the post-COVID era (Skift Research, 2024a).

## Industry Spotlight: How an Independent Hotel Optimized Its OTA Strategy

**The Property:** The Langham, a 372-room luxury hotel in a major gateway city, operating as part of an international brand but with significant operational independence in distribution decisions.

**The Challenge:** In 2019, OTA channels accounted for 38% of the hotel's room revenue, with an average blended commission rate of 19.2%. The hotel's revenue management team calculated that this translated to approximately $4.3 million in annual OTA commissions. Meanwhile, the hotel's direct channel (brand.com + voice) represented only 28% of bookings, with customer acquisition costs averaging 8%.

**The Strategy:**
1. **Content Optimization.** The hotel invested in professional photography and videography for its OTA listings, increasing its Booking.com content score from 72 to 94 (out of 100). This improved conversion rates by approximately 15%.

2. **Review Management.** A dedicated team responded to every OTA review within 24 hours. The hotel's Booking.com review score increased from 8.4 to 8.9 over 18 months, triggering algorithmic ranking improvements.

3. **Selective Program Participation.** Rather than enrolling in Preferred Partner year-round, the hotel activated the program only during shoulder months (January–March, September–November), reducing annual premium commission spend by approximately $280,000.

4. **Direct Booking Investment.** The hotel simultaneously invested $350,000 in website redesign, a new booking engine, and a digital marketing campaign targeting past guests and high-intent search traffic. The campaign leveraged the billboard effect—retargeting consumers who had viewed the hotel on OTAs with direct booking offers.

**The Results (2019–2023):**
- OTA share of bookings decreased from 38% to 29%
- Direct channel share increased from 28% to 39%
- Blended distribution cost decreased from 14.1% to 11.3% of room revenue
- Net RevPAR increased by 8.4%, even after accounting for investments in direct channels

**The Lesson:** OTA optimization and direct booking investment are not mutually exclusive—they are complementary strategies that, when executed together, improve both reach and profitability.

## Discussion Questions

1. **The Billboard Effect Trade-Off.** A hotel general manager argues that OTA commissions are justified because of the billboard effect—OTA listings drive direct bookings. A revenue manager counters that the billboard effect is declining and that OTA commissions should be minimized. Evaluate both perspectives and propose a framework for determining the optimal OTA investment level.

2. **Rate Parity Ethics.** Rate parity clauses restrict a hotel's ability to offer lower rates on its own website. From the perspectives of (a) the hotel, (b) the OTA, and (c) the consumer, evaluate whether rate parity clauses are fair. How do different regulatory approaches (European bans vs. U.S. market-driven) affect each stakeholder?

3. **Regional OTA Strategy.** You are the revenue manager for a 200-room resort hotel in Bali, Indonesia. Your current OTA distribution is 70% Booking.com, 20% Expedia, and 10% Agoda. Propose a revised OTA strategy that accounts for the regional dynamics discussed in this chapter. Which additional platforms would you add, and why?

4. **AI and the Future of OTA Ranking.** As OTAs increasingly use AI to personalize search results, how might this change the strategies hotels use to achieve visibility? What new skills will revenue managers need?

5. **The Duopoly's Durability.** Given the competitive dynamics described in this chapter—including regional challengers, Google's expanding role in travel, and the growth of direct booking—do you believe the Booking Holdings–Expedia Group duopoly will strengthen or weaken over the next decade? Support your argument with evidence.
