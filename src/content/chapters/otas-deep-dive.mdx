## Opening Vignette

In the spring of 2020, as COVID-19 shuttered hotels across the globe, Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel faced an existential reckoning. The Amsterdam-based travel giant—parent of Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Kayak, and OpenTable—saw gross travel bookings plummet 91% in April 2020 compared to the prior year (Booking Holdings, 2020). Virtually overnight, the company that had processed over $96 billion in travel bookings in 2019 watched its pipeline evaporate. Fogel laid off thousands, drew down credit lines, and prepared for a recovery whose timeline nobody could predict.

Yet by 2023, Booking Holdings reported record gross travel bookings of $150.6 billion—exceeding pre-pandemic levels by more than 50% (Booking Holdings, 2024a). Its market capitalization surpassed $130 billion, making it one of the most valuable travel companies on earth. The rebound was not accidental. Booking.com had spent two decades building a distribution machine of staggering scale: 28 million listings across 43 languages, a marketing spend exceeding $6 billion annually, and an algorithm-driven marketplace that connected hotels with travelers more efficiently than any individual property could achieve on its own.

However, the Online Travel Agency (OTA) oligopoly faces new challenges. According to Skift Research analysis, in 2024 OTAs generated $266 billion in gross bookings versus $262 billion for hotel direct channels—a remarkably narrow margin that signals the first serious challenge to OTA dominance in over two decades (Schaal, 2025). The four major OTA conglomerates (Booking Holdings, Expedia Group, Airbnb, and Trip.com Group) still control approximately two-thirds of global gross bookings, but their grip is loosening as hotels reclaim direct booking share and new technologies reshape distribution economics.

The scale of the online travel market is staggering: GlobalData estimates the global online travel market reached **$1.13 trillion** in 2024, with online sales forecast to grow at a CAGR of 9.18% to **$1.76 trillion** by 2029 (GlobalData, 2025a). This growth has been supported by increased digitalization, greater mobile phone usage, and the expansion of internet access worldwide — and it has come largely at the expense of in-store travel agents.

For hotel operators, the story of OTAs is one of profound ambivalence. These platforms deliver guests that properties could never reach independently—yet they extract commissions of 15% to 25% for the privilege, control the customer relationship, and increasingly set the terms of engagement. Understanding how OTAs rose to dominance, how their business models work, and how to manage these relationships strategically is among the most consequential skills in modern hospitality management.


## Learning Objectives

After reading this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Trace the origins and evolution** of the major OTAs, explaining how Expedia and Booking.com rose to dominate global hotel distribution.
2. **Compare and contrast OTA business models**—agency, merchant, and hybrid—and analyze how commission structures affect hotel profitability.
3. **Evaluate the competitive dynamics** of the Booking Holdings–Expedia Group duopoly, including market share, strategic differences, and regional competitors.
4. **Analyze OTA ranking algorithms and rate parity clauses**, explaining how these mechanisms shape hotel visibility and pricing strategy.
5. **Develop strategies for managing OTA relationships** that balance reach and revenue, including leveraging the billboard effect and optimizing channel mix.


## 9.1 The OTA Origin Story

### The Birth of Online Travel

The story of online travel agencies begins in 1996, a year that fundamentally altered how human beings plan and purchase travel. Two companies launched within months of each other, each backed by technology giants, each convinced that the internet would disintermediate the $400 billion global travel industry.

**Expedia** emerged from Microsoft's interactive media division. In October 1996, Microsoft launched Expedia.com as an online travel agency, initially leveraging data from the Worldspan Global Distribution System (GDS) to offer airline tickets, hotel rooms, and rental cars through a single consumer-facing website (May, 2021). The vision was audacious: replace the neighborhood travel agent with a website that could search, compare, and book travel products in minutes rather than hours. Rich Barton, Expedia's founding CEO, understood that the internet's power lay in information asymmetry reduction—giving consumers access to pricing and inventory data that had previously been locked inside GDS terminals accessible only to licensed travel agents.

**Travelocity**, backed by Sabre Holdings (the GDS operator), launched in the same year with a similar premise. Both proved that consumers were eager to research and book travel online.

In 1997, Jay Walker launched **Priceline.com** with its patented "Name Your Own Price" model — an opaque booking system that allowed consumers to bid on hotel rooms without knowing the property until after purchase (Walker, 1999). The model enabled hotels to sell distressed inventory at steep discounts without publicly advertising low rates. Xie, Anderson, and Verma (2017) later confirmed that willingness to pay differed significantly between opaque and transparent channels. Priceline went public in March 1999 and closed its first day at a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion (Hansell, 1999).

### Booking.com: The European Revolution

While American OTAs battled for dominance in the U.S. market, a quieter revolution was unfolding in the Netherlands. In 1996, Geert-Jan Bruinsma founded Bookings.nl, a small Dutch startup that listed Amsterdam hotels on the internet. The company's early insight was deceptively simple: European hotels were overwhelmingly independent and family-owned, lacking the centralized reservation systems and brand websites that American chains possessed. These properties desperately needed online distribution but had neither the technology nor the expertise to build it themselves.

Bookings.nl (later renamed Booking.com) developed an **agency model** radically different from the merchant approach: rather than purchasing inventory at wholesale rates, Booking.com listed hotels at their own prices and collected a commission only when a guest actually stayed (Schaal, 2018). This eliminated financial risk, preserved rate integrity, and was irresistibly easy to adopt—particularly for independent European properties. By the early 2000s, tens of thousands of European hotels had signed up.

In 2005, Priceline Group acquired Booking.com for approximately $133 million — in retrospect, one of the greatest bargains in internet history (Priceline Group, 2005). With massive investment in technology and marketing, Booking.com became the largest online accommodation platform in the world by 2012, surpassing Expedia in room nights sold (Schaal, 2018).

### How They Won

The OTA victors won through formidable competitive moats: **(1) Network effects** — more listings attracted more consumers in a self-reinforcing cycle; **(2) Marketing scale** — Booking Holdings alone spent $6.2 billion on performance marketing in 2023 (Booking Holdings, 2024a); **(3) Technology investment** in search, booking, payments, and reviews; **(4) Data advantages** from hundreds of millions of annual searches; and **(5) Global reach** across dozens of languages and currencies. As Carroll and Sileo (2014) argued, OTAs had evolved beyond booking intermediaries into powerful marketing engines and data platforms that fundamentally reshaped how consumers discover hotels.


## 9.2 OTA Business Models: Agency, Merchant, and Hybrid

Understanding how OTAs make money is essential for any hospitality professional managing distribution strategy. Three primary business models have evolved since the late 1990s, each with distinct implications for hotels.

### The Merchant Model

Under the merchant model, the OTA contracts with the hotel for rooms at a **net rate**—a wholesale price that is typically 20–40% below the hotel's published retail rate. The OTA then sets the consumer-facing price, keeps the markup as its revenue, and collects payment directly from the guest at the time of booking. The hotel receives payment from the OTA, usually after the guest's stay, at the predetermined net rate.

**How it works in practice:**
- Hotel provides a net rate of $120 per night to the OTA
- OTA sells the room to the consumer at $160
- OTA retains the $40 difference (25% margin)
- Guest pays the OTA at booking; hotel is paid by the OTA post-stay

This model dominated the U.S. market through the mid-2010s. Its advantages for OTAs were significant: opaque markups, pricing control, and reduced cancellation risk through prepayment. For hotels, it provided guaranteed revenue but at the cost of pricing control—hotels complained that OTAs resold rooms at prices undercutting direct rates, eroding brand value (Toh et al., 2011).

### The Agency Model

The agency model, championed by Booking.com, operates on a fundamentally different principle. The hotel sets its own retail price and manages its own inventory. The OTA displays this price to consumers and facilitates the booking, but the **guest pays the hotel directly**—either at check-in or, increasingly, through online payment facilitated by the OTA. The OTA earns a **commission** on the completed stay, typically ranging from 15% to 25% of the room revenue.

**How it works in practice:**
- Hotel lists a room at $160 per night on the OTA
- Guest books and pays the hotel directly (or via OTA-facilitated payment)
- OTA invoices the hotel a 17% commission: $27.20
- Hotel retains $132.80

The agency model preserves the hotel's pricing control and improves cash flow. However, commissions can be substantial—hotels in visibility-boosting programs (such as Booking.com's "Preferred Partner") may pay 20% or higher. Guo, Anderson, Dong, Zhao, and Ji (2020) found that the standard commission model does not always align incentives between hotels and distributors, particularly when OTAs have significant bargaining power over smaller properties.

### The Hybrid Model

By the mid-2010s, the distinction blurred. Today, most major OTAs operate a **hybrid model**. Booking.com's **Payments platform** (2018) enabled it to process guest payments directly within its agency framework—by 2023, approximately 40% of gross bookings flowed through this platform (Booking Holdings, 2024a), moving its economics closer to a merchant model in practice. Expedia Group, conversely, expanded agency offerings through its Expedia Partner Solutions (EPS) B2B division, which supplies hotel inventory to third-party travel companies on a commission basis.

The critical calculation is **effective net revenue** per room night: a 17% agency commission on a $200 rate yields $166 net, while a merchant model paying a $155 net rate yields $155—even though the merchant model may appear simpler.


## 9.3 The Duopoly: Booking Holdings vs. Expedia Group

### Market Structure

The global OTA landscape is dominated by two holding companies whose combined market share of OTA-intermediated hotel bookings exceeds 65% worldwide (Phocuswright, 2024). In the U.S. alone, OTAs posted $108.5 billion in gross bookings in 2024—up 4% year-over-year and 85% above 2019 levels, with Phocuswright (2025) identifying B2B expansion, loyalty-driven yield, AI-powered virtual agents, dynamic packaging, and Airbnb competition as the five defining trends. Vives, Jacob, and Payeras (2021) reinforced the importance of understanding OTA dynamics, identifying distribution channel management as one of the most critical yet under-researched topics in their meta-analysis of 76 hotel revenue management papers.

### Strategic Differences

Despite competing for the same hotel bookings, the two companies have pursued meaningfully different strategies:

**Booking Holdings: The Single-Brand Juggernaut.** Under Glenn Fogel, Booking Holdings has concentrated its strategy around Booking.com, pursuing a "connected trip" vision that bundles flights, hotels, car rentals, attractions, and restaurants into a single super-app (Fogel, 2023). With 300M+ app downloads, Booking.com's dominance is most pronounced in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific.

**Expedia Group: The Multi-Brand Platform.** Expedia historically operated as a portfolio of distinct brands (Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotwire). Under CEO Peter Kern (2020–2023) and subsequently Ariane Gorin, the company consolidated technology onto a single platform and unified loyalty under "One Key" (launched 2023; Expedia Group, 2024a). Expedia's strength in North America—particularly corporate and package travel—differentiates it from Booking.com's accommodation-first approach.

### The Financial Gap

The most striking feature of the duopoly is the widening gap between the two companies. In 2015, Booking Holdings and Expedia Group had roughly comparable market capitalizations. By mid-2025, Booking Holdings was valued at approximately **eight times** Expedia Group — $186 billion versus $23 billion (Agarwal, 2025c). This divergence reflects Booking.com's superior growth in international markets, its higher operating margins (EBITDA margin of **35%** vs. Expedia's **18%**), and investor confidence in its single-brand strategy.

The golden era from 2003 to 2019 saw combined gross bookings grow at a **20% CAGR** and duopoly market share expand from **5% to 22%** (Agarwal, 2024a). But growth has decelerated to **single digits** from 2024 onward, roughly matching major hotel groups for the first time (Agarwal, 2025b), and customer satisfaction scores have converged from a **6-point gap** to just **1 point** (Agarwal, 2024a).

### Beyond the Duopoly: Hopper and the Rise of Challenger OTAs

While Booking Holdings and Expedia Group dominate the global OTA landscape, a new generation of challengers is disrupting the competitive order — and none more visibly than **Hopper**.

Founded in Montreal in 2007 by former Expedia executives Frederic Lalonde and Joost Ouwerkerk, Hopper spent nearly a decade building a structured database of travel information and price-prediction algorithms before selling its first flight booking in 2016 (Agarwal, 2023b). By 2022, Hopper had grown to approximately **$3.5 billion in gross bookings** and an estimated **$455 million in revenue** — still just 3–4% of Booking or Expedia's scale, but with a take rate of **12–14%** that matched its larger competitors, largely thanks to its innovative fintech products (Agarwal, 2023b). In 2021, Hopper became the **most downloaded travel app in the U.S.**, and its share of total app usage grew from 11% of the U.S. market in 2019 to **19%** by 2023, making it the **third-largest OTA in North America** (Agarwal, 2023b).

What differentiates Hopper is not merely its size but its *model*:

- **Fintech as a distribution lever.** In early 2019, Hopper launched "Price Freeze" — allowing customers to lock in a price using its prediction models. This was followed by a full suite of anxiety-alleviating fintech products (cancel-for-any-reason, rebooking guarantees, flight disruption protection). Fintech now constitutes approximately **40% of Hopper's total revenue** and turns air travel — typically a loss-leader for OTAs — into a profit center. As co-founder Dakota Smith explained: "The existence of fintech turns air travel from what is generally a loss maker at other travel agencies into a small profit center for Hopper" (as cited in Agarwal, 2023b).

- **B2B expansion through Hopper Cloud.** Launched in 2021, Hopper Cloud powers travel capabilities for Capital One, Uber, and Australia's CommBank, among others. It also provides fintech products to travel platforms like Agoda and Kayak. The B2B business now represents roughly **40% of revenue**, diversifying Hopper beyond consumer-facing bookings.

- **Gen Z–native design.** With **80% of bookers aged 18–35** and an average booker age of 25, Hopper is purpose-built for younger travelers. The app features gamification (its "Carrot Cash" loyalty currency), social commerce elements inspired by Chinese platform Pinduoduo, and a marketing strategy centered on TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat rather than traditional search engine marketing (Agarwal, 2023b).

- **App-only model.** Hopper has no functional desktop booking experience — a deliberate strategic choice that reinforces its mobile-first positioning and reduces customer acquisition costs by avoiding the expensive Search Engine Marketing (SEM) (search engine marketing) spending that Booking.com and Expedia rely on.

For the hotel industry, Hopper represents both a distribution opportunity and a cautionary tale. Its fintech model demonstrates that OTA innovation is far from exhausted, and that "monetizing traveler anxiety" — through products that address the stress of price volatility and cancellation risk — is a direct consequence of the opaque pricing and restrictive policies that the legacy OTA model perpetuated. Hotels that understand this dynamic can adapt their own direct-booking value propositions accordingly.

**The global OTA market in perspective.** GlobalData (2024) projects the global OTA market will reach **$1.21 trillion by 2027** (12.27% CAGR from $764.69 billion in 2023). The U.S. remains the largest market at **$354.26 billion** (46.33% of the global total). Leisure travelers account for **79%** of OTA market value, Millennials represent **44.69%** of bookers, and domestic trips contribute **71%**—a pandemic-era share increase that has not reverted.


## 9.4 Commission Structures and Negotiation

### Standard Commission Rates

OTA commissions represent one of the largest variable costs in hotel operations. Understanding the range and structure of these commissions is essential for financial planning and distribution strategy.

According to the Skift Research *Hotel Distribution Outlook 2024*, average OTA commission rates in 2024 were:
- **Independent hotels (global average):** 17.5%
- **Branded/chain hotels (global average):** 13.5%
- **U.S. market range:** 15–25%, with most falling between 15% and 20%
- **Premium placement programs:** 20–30% (for enhanced visibility)

*(Source: Skift Research, 2024a)*

Abdullah, Van Cauwenberge, Vander Bauwhede, and O'Connor (2022), in a study published in *Tourism Review*, assessed the financial impact of Booking.com participation on hotel profitability — finding that the relationship between OTA reliance and financial outcomes varies significantly by hotel type and market context, with some properties benefiting from incremental demand while others experience margin compression. O'Connor, Assaker, and El Haddad (2025), in a groundbreaking empirical study published in the *Cornell Hospitality Quarterly*, investigated the financial contribution of OTA participation to U.S. hotel profitability — finding that the relationship between OTA reliance and bottom-line performance is more nuanced than the simple "commissions erode profits" narrative suggests, with incremental demand generation offsetting commission costs under certain market conditions.

The disparity reflects bargaining power: major chains negotiate group-wide contracts leveraging hundreds of thousands of rooms, while independents negotiate from relative weakness. The level of interdependence is higher than commonly assumed. Skift Research analysis of 2018 U.S. booking data estimated that as much as **20%** of Marriott's U.S. bookings and **40%** of Hyatt's came from Booking Holdings or Expedia Group sites — and that four major branded chains (Hilton, Hyatt, IHG, Marriott) may have collectively accounted for **a third of Booking Holdings' U.S. bookings and 55% of Expedia Group's** (Borko, 2021, pp. 7–8). Independent hotel reliance on OTAs may be overstated: independents rely more heavily on wholesalers, bed banks, and tour operators than is commonly appreciated.

### Commission Tiers and Visibility Programs

OTAs offer greater visibility in exchange for higher commissions: **Booking.com's Preferred Partner Program** charges 3–5 points above base rate (18–22%) for improved ranking (Booking.com, 2024); **Expedia's Accelerator Program** lets hotels temporarily boost ranking by increasing commission during low-demand periods; and **Genius/Member Deals** on Booking.com offer 10–20% discounts to frequent bookers funded from hotel margins—a 10% Genius discount on a 17% commission room means the hotel nets approximately 75% of retail.

### Negotiation Strategies

Key approaches include: **(1) Volume leverage** — hotels generating 5,000+ room nights annually can negotiate lower base rates; **(2) Selective participation** — activating visibility programs during shoulder seasons only; **(3) Rate structure optimization** — curating room types and rate plans rather than full inventory access; **(4) Multi-OTA diversification** to create competitive tension; and **(5) Annual contract reviews** using conversion, cancellation, and booking value data.


## 9.5 OTA Ranking Algorithms: How Hotels Get Visibility

### The Black Box

Each major OTA employs proprietary **ranking algorithms** that determine hotel search result order. Position directly correlates with booking volume: Expedia (2017) found that first-page hotels receive dramatically more clicks and bookings than those on subsequent pages.

### Key Ranking Factors

While OTAs do not publish exact algorithms, the primary factors influencing ranking are: **(1) Commission rate / margin** — higher commissions generally yield better placement, the most commercially significant and controversial factor; **(2) Conversion rate** — hotels converting more page views into bookings earn better visibility; **(3) Guest review scores** — weighted heavily, with a self-reinforcing cycle (better reviews → better rankings → more bookings → more reviews); **(4) Content completeness** — high-quality photos, descriptions, and amenity lists improve OTA-measured "content scores"; **(5) Availability and pricing competitiveness** relative to the comp set; **(6) Flexible cancellation policies**; and **(7) OTA program participation** (Preferred Partner, Genius, etc.).

### Strategic Implications

**OTA SEO**—regularly updating photos, responding to reviews, monitoring competitive pricing, and analyzing conversion metrics—is essential. Hotels that treat listings as passive directory entries will be progressively buried in search results.


## 9.6 Rate Parity: The Controversial Cornerstone

### What Is Rate Parity?

**Rate parity** refers to the contractual requirement, imposed by OTAs, that hotels maintain consistent pricing across all distribution channels. Under a strict rate parity clause, a hotel cannot offer a lower rate on its own website, through another OTA, or through any other publicly available channel than the rate displayed on the OTA in question.

OTAs argue parity maintains consumer trust; hotels counter that it prevents incentivizing direct bookings. The industry distinguishes **wide parity** (hotel must match OTA rates across all channels) from **narrow parity** (must match only on hotel's own online channels).

### Global Legal Challenges

Rate parity has faced sustained regulatory challenges worldwide. **France** led with the **Loi Macron** (2015), banning rate parity entirely (République Française, 2015); Austria, Italy, and Belgium followed. **Germany's** Federal Cartel Office ruled Booking.com's wide parity anti-competitive in 2015 (Bundeskartellamt, 2015). The **UK** CMA accepted commitments from OTAs to move to narrow parity (CMA, 2015), and **Australia's** ACCC accepted similar voluntary commitments (ACCC, 2016). The **United States** has taken a market-driven approach with no federal legislation, while **Asia-Pacific** markets have generally moved toward narrow parity or bans.

### The Current State

The global trend is clearly toward the erosion of wide rate parity, with most major OTAs now operating under narrow parity. However, narrow parity still constrains hotels' ability to undercut OTA rates on their own websites. Hunold, Kesler, Laitenberger, and Schlütter (2018) provided some of the first rigorous evidence that rate parity enforcement led to higher, more uniform hotel prices. Mantovani, Piga, and Reggiani (2021) demonstrated that removing wide parity clauses led to measurable price reductions and increased price dispersion. Kathuria and Mackenrodt (2021) argued that even narrow parity clauses meaningfully restrain competition. The practical effect: hotels must drive direct bookings through member-only discounts, package deals, and closed-user-group rates that comply with narrow parity while offering direct bookers better value.


## 9.7 The Billboard Effect: OTA Marketing Power

### What Is the Billboard Effect?

The **billboard effect**, first documented by Professor Chris Anderson of Cornell University (2009), describes the phenomenon whereby hotels listed on OTAs experience increased bookings through their own websites — Anderson found a **7.5–26% lift** in direct bookings for hotels listed on Expedia.com. The OTA listing acts as an advertisement that the hotel pays for only when a booking occurs on the OTA itself.

The effect has been both celebrated and contested. Proponents cite Phocuswright (2013) data showing 75% of OTA searchers visited the hotel's direct website before booking. Skeptics note Anderson's own follow-up (2011) found the effect varied significantly by hotel type, and Bowen and Whalen (2017) suggested it was weakening. The practical reality: hotels with strong direct propositions capture more billboard-effect bookings; the effect should inform but not justify uncritical OTA dependence (see Chapter 3).


## 9.8 Managing OTA Relationships: The Love-Hate Dynamic

### The Fundamental Tension

Hotels need OTAs for global reach, access to new customer segments, and demand during low-occupancy periods—yet they resent high commissions, loss of customer data, rate parity restrictions, and loyalty accruing to the platform rather than the brand (see also Chapter 4). Toh, Raven, and DeKay (2011) documented this tension empirically, finding that hoteliers consistently viewed OTAs as a necessary but costly distribution channel, with resentment growing as commission rates rose and rate control eroded.

The tension is also structural. OTAs operate as **two-sided platforms** connecting supply (hotels) with demand (travelers), a market structure extensively studied in platform economics. Rochet and Tirole (2003), in foundational work on two-sided markets published in the *RAND Journal of Economics*, demonstrated that platforms optimally subsidize one side of the market (travelers, through loyalty discounts and free cancellation) while extracting rents from the other (hotels, through commissions). Understanding this dynamic is essential: OTA commission rates are not arbitrary but reflect the platform's rational strategy to maximize traveler volume by shifting costs to the supply side.

### A Framework for OTA Relationship Management

Rather than a simple list of tactics, effective OTA management requires a structured approach organized around four strategic pillars:

**Pillar 1: Portfolio Diversification.** Relying on a single OTA creates dangerous dependency. Hotels should distribute across 2–3 major OTAs plus relevant regional platforms (see Section 9.9), allocating inventory strategically based on each platform's source market strengths, commission structures, and cancellation profiles. Competitive tension between platforms also provides negotiation leverage.

**Pillar 2: Data-Driven Program Participation.** OTA extranet dashboards provide rich performance data—conversion rates, cancellation rates, average booking values, and competitive positioning. Revenue managers should review these analytics monthly and make evidence-based decisions about participation in visibility programs (Preferred Partner, Genius, Accelerator). The key principle: activate premium programs during shoulder seasons and low-demand periods when incremental reach matters most, and scale back during peak periods when direct demand is sufficient.

**Pillar 3: Content and Conversion Optimization.** As Section 9.5 established, OTA ranking algorithms reward high-converting listings. Hotels should treat their OTA listings with the same rigor they apply to brand.com: professional photography refreshed seasonally, complete and accurate amenity descriptions, prompt review responses, and competitive rate positioning. Anderson (2012) found that a one-point increase in user review scores correlated with an 11.2% ADR premium—evidence that reputation management is revenue management.

**Pillar 4: Rate Integrity and Leakage Monitoring.** Hotels must actively monitor rate parity across all channels, using tools like OTA Insight (now Lighthouse), RateGain, or Triptease to identify instances where wholesale rates leak onto unauthorized retail channels—undercutting both direct and OTA rates (see Chapter 10 for a comprehensive treatment of wholesale rate leakage).

**Pillar 5: Direct Channel Investment as Long-Term Defense.** The most effective OTA management strategy is, paradoxically, investing in direct channels. Every booking shifted from OTA to direct reduces commission exposure while building the proprietary guest data and loyalty relationships that compound over time (see Chapter 4). The goal is not OTA elimination but optimal balance.

### The Negotiation Cycle

OTA contracts should be treated as living documents, renegotiated annually using performance data. Hotels with 5,000+ annual OTA room nights have meaningful leverage; those generating 10,000+ can often negotiate commission reductions of 1–3 percentage points—worth tens of thousands of dollars annually. Key negotiation data points include year-over-year booking volume trends, cancellation rates (lower is leverage), average booking values relative to the OTA's portfolio average, and competitive offers from rival platforms.


## 9.9 Regional OTAs: Beyond the Duopoly

While Booking Holdings and Expedia Group dominate the global OTA landscape, several regional platforms command significant market share in their home markets and are increasingly expanding internationally.

### Trip.com Group (Formerly Ctrip)

**Headquarters:** Shanghai, China
**Key Brands:** Ctrip, Trip.com, Skyscanner, Qunar, Tongcheng Travel (investment)
**2023 Revenue:** $6.9 billion (Trip.com Group, 2024)

Trip.com Group dominates China's domestic travel market with deep WeChat/Alipay integration and 87 million Chinese outbound trips in 2023 (China Tourism Academy, 2024). By gross bookings it is the world's largest OTA—$129 billion in 2019—though a ~4% take rate yields just $5.3 billion in revenue (Borko, 2020b). Over 80% of bookings are mobile.

### MakeMyTrip

**Headquarters:** Gurugram, India
**Key Brands:** MakeMyTrip, Goibibo, redBus
**2023 Revenue:** $672 million (MakeMyTrip, 2024)

MakeMyTrip dominates India's online travel market, which is one of the fastest-growing in the world. India's outbound travel market is projected to grow from 27 million departures in 2023 to over 50 million by 2030 (CAPA India, 2024), making MakeMyTrip an increasingly important distribution partner for international hotels.

### Despegar

**Headquarters:** Buenos Aires, Argentina (incorporated in British Virgin Islands)
**Key Brands:** Despegar, Decolar (Brazil)
**2023 Revenue:** $602 million (Despegar, 2024)

Despegar leads Latin America across 19 countries, with advantages in local payment integration (installment plans), language optimization, and regional travel knowledge.

### Other Notable Regional Players

Other significant platforms include **Yanolja/Interpark Triple** (South Korea), **Traveloka** (Southeast Asia), **Ozon Travel/Ostrovok** (Russia, which gained share after Western platforms exited in 2022), and **Hotel Urbano** (Brazil).

### Strategic Implications for Hotels

Regional OTAs matter because travel demand is not uniform. A luxury resort in the Maldives may find 40% of OTA bookings originate from Ctrip; a boutique hotel in Mexico City may discover Despegar delivers higher average booking values than Expedia. Effective distribution strategy requires understanding which platforms your source markets use.


## 9.10 OTA Strategies Post-COVID

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated several strategic shifts that continue to reshape the OTA industry.

### Flexibility and the "Connected Trip"

COVID-era cancellation chaos made **flexible cancellation policies** the consumer default—driving cancellation rates of 30–40% for OTA bookings and requiring more aggressive overbooking strategies (Skift Research, 2024a). Both major OTAs responded by expanding beyond accommodation into comprehensive travel platforms: Booking.com's "connected trip" bundles flights, hotels, car rentals, and activities, while Expedia's "One Key" loyalty program pursues similar cross-brand engagement (Expedia Group, 2024a)—a trend Carroll, Kwortnik, and Rose (2007) presciently anticipated. Expedia's **B2B pivot** is particularly significant: by 2026, its B2B division was growing 5x faster than consumer brands (Expedia Group, 2026).

### AI and the Next Competitive Frontier

OTAs are investing heavily in AI-powered personalization and trip planning. Booking.com's AI trip planner, launched in 2023, uses conversational AI to recommend destinations and properties based on natural language preferences (Booking Holdings, 2024b). Expedia followed with a ChatGPT-integrated planning feature in its app. The strategic logic is clear: AI enables OTAs to engage travelers earlier in the planning journey—at the "dreaming" phase—before they think to visit a hotel brand's website.

For hotels, the AI threat extends beyond OTAs. As Chapter 4 (Section 4.2) documented, both Marriott and Hilton flagged generative AI platforms as material risks to their direct-booking strategies in 2026 SEC filings. If AI assistants recommend hotels and link to OTAs rather than brand.com, hotels could face higher commission costs on demand they previously captured directly. Parker, Van Alstyne, and Choudary (2016), in their influential analysis of platform economics, predicted that AI would intensify platform power by concentrating data advantages—a dynamic now playing out in real time in travel distribution. For a full analysis of AI's impact on hospitality distribution, see Chapters 12 and 13.

### Alternative Accommodations: Intra-Platform Competition

Both major OTAs have expanded alternative accommodation listings aggressively. Booking.com now lists 7M+ non-hotel properties (apartments, vacation rentals, homes), while Expedia operates Vrbo alongside its hotel inventory. For traditional hotels, this creates intra-platform competition: a traveler searching for a "three-night stay in Rome" now sees hotels competing against apartments and vacation rentals in the same OTA results. Zervas, Proserpio, and Byers (2017), in a study published in the *Journal of Marketing Research*, demonstrated that Airbnb's entry into major markets reduced hotel revenues by 8–10% in the lower-price segments—evidence that alternative accommodations are not simply a different market but a direct competitive threat within shared distribution platforms.

### The Direct Booking Trajectory: A Narrowing Gap

The balance of power between OTAs and direct channels is shifting measurably. OTAs generated $266 billion in hotel gross bookings in 2024 versus $262 billion from direct digital channels—a remarkably narrow gap that would have been unthinkable a decade ago (Agarwal, 2024b). By 2030, direct channels are projected to generate over $400 billion versus $333 billion from OTAs, marking the first time direct digital will outpace OTA distribution (see Chapter 4 for the full trajectory).

Yet the OTA sector itself continues to grow in absolute terms: **$94 billion** in revenue in 2024 (48% above 2019) on **$794 billion** in gross bookings, with hotels contributing **$52 billion** (56%) of OTA revenue (Zanpure, 2025). The coexistence of direct-booking growth and OTA expansion reflects a growing total market rather than a zero-sum contest (Awuse, 2026). The strategic implication: hotels should not expect OTAs to shrink, but they can—and should—ensure that direct channels grow faster.


## Industry Spotlight: How an Independent Hotel Optimized Its OTA Strategy

**The Property:** The Langham, a 372-room luxury hotel in a major gateway city, operating as part of an international brand but with significant operational independence in distribution decisions.

**The Challenge:** In 2019, OTA channels accounted for 38% of the hotel's room revenue, with an average blended commission rate of 19.2%. The hotel's revenue management team calculated that this translated to approximately $4.3 million in annual OTA commissions. Meanwhile, the hotel's direct channel (brand.com + voice) represented only 28% of bookings, with customer acquisition costs averaging 8%.

**The Strategy:**
1. **Content Optimization.** The hotel invested in professional photography and videography for its OTA listings, increasing its Booking.com content score from 72 to 94 (out of 100). This improved conversion rates by approximately 15%.

2. **Review Management.** A dedicated team responded to every OTA review within 24 hours. The hotel's Booking.com review score increased from 8.4 to 8.9 over 18 months, triggering algorithmic ranking improvements.

3. **Selective Program Participation.** Rather than enrolling in Preferred Partner year-round, the hotel activated the program only during shoulder months (January–March, September–November), reducing annual premium commission spend by approximately $280,000.

4. **Direct Booking Investment.** The hotel simultaneously invested $350,000 in website redesign, a new booking engine, and a digital marketing campaign targeting past guests and high-intent search traffic. The campaign leveraged the billboard effect—retargeting consumers who had viewed the hotel on OTAs with direct booking offers.

**The Results (2019–2023):**
- OTA share of bookings decreased from 38% to 29%
- Direct channel share increased from 28% to 39%
- Blended distribution cost decreased from 14.1% to 11.3% of room revenue
- Revenue Per Available Room (Net RevPAR) increased by 8.4%, even after accounting for investments in direct channels

**The Lesson:** OTA optimization and direct booking investment are not mutually exclusive—they are complementary strategies that, when executed together, improve both reach and profitability.


## Chapter Summary

This chapter traced OTA evolution from Expedia and Priceline's launches through Booking.com's agency-model revolution, examined the business models that define OTA economics, and analyzed the Booking Holdings–Expedia Group duopoly. Commission structures, ranking algorithms, rate parity regulation, the billboard effect, regional platforms, and post-COVID shifts—including the connected-trip vision and the narrowing gap between OTA and direct-booking share—round out the strategic framework for managing these powerful intermediaries.

In Chapter 10, we turn to the wholesale distribution channel — bed banks, tour operators, and net-rate supply chains that connect hotels to demand they could never reach directly, while creating the industry's most persistent rate integrity challenges.


## Key Terms

- **Agency Model** — An OTA business model where the hotel sets the rate, the guest pays the hotel, and the OTA earns a commission on the completed stay.
- **Billboard Effect** — The phenomenon where a hotel's listing on an OTA generates awareness that drives bookings through the hotel's own direct channels.
- **Commission** — A percentage of room revenue paid by the hotel to the OTA for each booking sourced through the platform.
- **Connected Trip** — Booking Holdings' strategy to bundle multiple travel products (flights, hotels, cars, activities) into a single, integrated booking experience.
- **Duopoly** — A market structure dominated by two firms; in the OTA context, Booking Holdings and Expedia Group.
- **Genius Program** — Booking.com's tiered loyalty program offering discounts to frequent users, funded by participating hotels.
- **Hybrid Model** — An OTA business model combining elements of both agency and merchant approaches.
- **Merchant Model** — An OTA business model where the OTA purchases inventory at a net rate and resells it at a markup, collecting payment from the guest.
- **Narrow Rate Parity** — A contractual clause requiring hotels to offer the OTA a rate no higher than the rate on the hotel's own direct channels.
- **Net Rate** — The wholesale price at which a hotel sells inventory to an intermediary, before the intermediary's markup.
- **OTA Ranking Algorithm** — The proprietary formula used by an OTA to determine the order in which hotels appear in search results.
- **OTA SEO** — The practice of optimizing a hotel's OTA listing (content, reviews, conversion metrics) to improve ranking position.
- **Rate Parity** — The contractual requirement that a hotel maintain consistent pricing across distribution channels.
- **Wide Rate Parity** — A contractual clause requiring hotels to offer the OTA a rate no higher than the rate available on any other distribution channel.


## Discussion Questions

1. **The Billboard Effect Trade-Off.** A hotel general manager argues that OTA commissions are justified because of the billboard effect—OTA listings drive direct bookings. A revenue manager counters that the billboard effect is declining and that OTA commissions should be minimized. Evaluate both perspectives and propose a framework for determining the optimal OTA investment level.

2. **Rate Parity Ethics.** Rate parity clauses restrict a hotel's ability to offer lower rates on its own website. From the perspectives of (a) the hotel, (b) the OTA, and (c) the consumer, evaluate whether rate parity clauses are fair. How do different regulatory approaches (European bans vs. U.S. market-driven) affect each stakeholder?

3. **Regional OTA Strategy.** You are the revenue manager for a 200-room resort hotel in Bali, Indonesia. Your current OTA distribution is 70% Booking.com, 20% Expedia, and 10% Agoda. Propose a revised OTA strategy that accounts for the regional dynamics discussed in this chapter. Which additional platforms would you add, and why?

4. **AI and the Future of OTA Ranking.** As OTAs increasingly use AI to personalize search results, how might this change the strategies hotels use to achieve visibility? What new skills will revenue managers need?

5. **The Duopoly's Durability.** Given the competitive dynamics described in this chapter—including regional challengers, Google's expanding role in travel, and the growth of direct booking—do you believe the Booking Holdings–Expedia Group duopoly will strengthen or weaken over the next decade? Support your argument with evidence.
