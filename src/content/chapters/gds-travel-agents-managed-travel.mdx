## Opening Vignette: Two Intermediaries, Two Worlds

Sarah Nakamura starts her Monday morning in a glass-walled office on the thirty-second floor of a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company's headquarters in New Jersey. As Vice President of Global Travel, she oversees a managed travel program that moves 14,000 employees across 38 countries. Her company's agreement with American Express Global Business Travel (Amex GBT) routes every hotel booking through a centralized platform: employees search for approved properties via an online self-booking tool, the system queries the Global Distribution System (GDS) for negotiated rates at preferred hotels, and a reservation is confirmed in seconds. Behind that transaction sits an architecture of corporate rate agreements, duty-of-care tracking, expense policy enforcement, and consolidated billing. Sarah knows where every traveler is at any given moment. When a typhoon hit the Philippines last quarter, her team had relocated three employees to safe hotels within forty minutes—because the GDS-connected platform told them exactly who was booked where.

Three thousand miles away, in a sun-filled apartment in Venice Beach, California, Mia Torres opens her laptop and pulls up the Fora Travel advisor platform. Mia left a career in luxury hospitality marketing eighteen months ago to become a travel advisor, and this morning she is building a honeymoon itinerary for clients heading to the Maldives. She compares three properties—Soneva Fushi, Patina Maldives, and The St. Regis Maldives Vommuli—evaluating each on overwater villa quality, dining options, transfer logistics, and the specific amenity packages she can negotiate through her consortium affiliations. She will earn a 10 percent commission from whichever property the couple selects, and the hotel will receive a guest who stays longer, spends more on ancillary services, and almost never cancels. Mia is not processing a transaction. She is curating an experience.

Sarah and Mia are both intermediaries. Both sit between the hotel and the guest. Both generate bookings that hotels value. Yet their distribution mechanics could not be more different: one operates through automated systems and corporate contracts, the other through personal relationships and expert curation. Together, they represent a set of channels that account for a substantial share of global hotel revenue—channels that predate the internet, survived the rise of Online Travel Agencies (OTAs), and are now experiencing a remarkable resurgence.

This chapter examines the Global Distribution System, the travel advisor, and the Travel Management Company (TMC)—three interconnected channels that form the backbone of indirect hotel distribution outside the OTA ecosystem.


## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this chapter, you should be able to:

- Explain the architecture and economics of the Global Distribution System, including how hotels connect to the GDS and the cost structure of GDS-sourced bookings.
- Trace the decline and reinvention of the travel agent channel, from the internet disruption of the 1990s through the modern advisor renaissance.
- Compare the business models of modern travel advisor networks, including Fora Travel, Virtuoso, and other consortia, and articulate why hotels value advisor-sourced bookings.
- Describe the role of Travel Management Companies in corporate hotel distribution, including the RFP process, preferred rate programs, and duty-of-care requirements.
- Analyze the pressures facing the GDS from New Distribution Capability (NDC) technology and airline disintermediation, and assess the implications for hotel distribution.
- Develop a strategic framework for when and how hotels should invest in GDS, travel advisor, and TMC channels relative to other distribution options.


## 8.1 The Global Distribution System: Architecture and Economics

### What the GDS Is

The Global Distribution System is a computerized network that enables real-time transactions between travel service providers—hotels, airlines, car rental companies—and travel sellers such as travel agents, corporate booking tools, and online platforms. Think of it as a massive electronic marketplace: hotels make their inventory and rates available, and hundreds of thousands of travel sellers around the world can search, compare, and book that inventory instantly.

Three companies dominate the GDS landscape. Amadeus, headquartered in Madrid, commands approximately 40 percent of global GDS market share and is the largest by transaction volume. Sabre, based in Southlake, Texas, holds roughly 35 percent. Travelport, owned by Elliott Investment Management since its 2019 take-private transaction, accounts for approximately 22 percent and operates the Galileo, Apollo, and Worldspan systems under a unified platform (Rizvi, 2025). The global GDS market generated an estimated $6.78 billion in revenue in 2024, a figure that reflects both the system's scale and its enduring relevance in an era of direct booking campaigns and OTA dominance (GlobalData, 2025).

### How Hotels Connect

The path from a hotel's inventory to a travel agent's screen involves several intermediary technology layers. A hotel's Property Management System (PMS) feeds rates and availability to its Central Reservation System (CRS)—either a brand-operated system for chain hotels or a third-party CRS for independents. The CRS transmits that data through a switch or aggregator company (firms like Derbysoft or D-EDGE specialize in this connectivity layer) into the GDS networks. From there, the inventory becomes searchable by any travel agent with a GDS terminal, any corporate self-booking tool connected to a GDS, and many online platforms that pull GDS content.

The connectivity chain looks like this:

**PMS → CRS → Switch/Aggregator → GDS → Travel Agent Terminal / Online Booking Tool**

Each link in this chain must transmit accurate rate, availability, and content data in real time. A rate change entered at the property level should propagate through to the GDS within minutes. When the system works well, it delivers extraordinary reach: a single rate loaded into the CRS can be displayed to travel sellers in 190 countries simultaneously. When it fails—stale rates, incorrect room descriptions, missing photos—the hotel loses bookings to competitors whose GDS content is better maintained.

### The Economics

GDS distribution carries a layered cost structure that hotels must understand in granular detail. The GDS operator itself charges a transaction fee for each booking processed through its network, typically ranging from $5 to $12 per reservation depending on the hotel's volume, connectivity method, and negotiated agreement. On top of this, the travel agent or agency that makes the booking earns a commission—historically 10 percent of the room revenue, though this has compressed to 8–10 percent for many properties and programs (Estis Green & Lomanno, 2012). When transaction fees and commissions are combined, the total cost of a GDS-sourced booking typically falls in the range of 15 to 22 percent of room revenue—higher than a direct booking but, as we will see, often competitive with or lower than OTA commissions when guest value is considered holistically.

The average GDS hotel booking generates approximately $380 in total revenue, a figure that reflects the channel's heavy skew toward business travel and upper-midscale to luxury properties (SiteMinder, 2025). This is not a channel for $89-per-night economy hotels competing on price; it is a channel for properties whose rate structure can absorb the distribution cost and whose guest profile—primarily corporate travelers on managed programs—delivers high lifetime value.

### Performance Data: Why the GDS Punches Above Its Weight

The GDS represents roughly 18 percent of hotel bookings globally, a share that has remained remarkably stable even as OTAs and direct channels have grown (HEDNA, NYU Tisch Center, & RateGain, 2025). What makes the channel distinctive is not its volume but its quality metrics.

Data from D-EDGE, analyzing hotel distribution performance across channels, reveals a striking picture. GDS bookings deliver an Average Daily Rate (ADR) of €179—second only to direct bookings at €204 and substantially above OTA rates. The cancellation rate for GDS bookings is just 4.6 percent, compared to a staggering 37.2 percent for Booking Holdings channels and 24.8 percent for Expedia Group. The average Length of Stay (LOS) for GDS bookings is 2.55 days, exceeding most other indirect channels (D-EDGE, 2024). These metrics translate to higher net revenue per booking after accounting for distribution costs.

The channel's post-pandemic trajectory has been equally impressive. GDS hotel bookings surpassed their 2019 peak in 2024, and year-over-year growth from January to May 2024 reached 54 percent—faster than any other distribution channel tracked by D-EDGE (D-EDGE, 2024). This resurgence was driven primarily by the return of corporate travel, which accounts for 87 percent of GDS hotel reservations (Rizvi, 2025). As business travel spending recovered and surpassed pre-pandemic levels, the GDS reclaimed its position as the workhorse of corporate hotel distribution.

### Why the GDS Persists

Critics have predicted the GDS's demise for decades. In the early 2000s, airlines began pulling content from the GDS to drive direct bookings. In the 2010s, OTAs offered an alternative for leisure travelers. In the 2020s, New Distribution Capability technology promised to bypass the GDS entirely. Yet the system endures, for three fundamental reasons.

First, **corporate travel infrastructure depends on it**. The GDS is not merely a booking tool for corporate travel programs—it is the connective tissue that enables policy enforcement, duty-of-care tracking, consolidated reporting, and negotiated rate delivery. Replacing the GDS in a large corporate travel program would require rebuilding the entire technology stack that TMCs use to serve their clients.

Second, **aggregation creates efficiency**. A travel agent searching for a hotel in Frankfurt can compare rates across dozens of properties from multiple brands in a single query. No individual hotel website or brand app can replicate this comparison-shopping functionality at the point of sale.

Third, **the economics work for the right properties**. For a hotel with strong corporate demand, the GDS delivers high-ADR, low-cancellation, repeat business at a total cost that compares favorably to OTAs—particularly when the lifetime value of corporate accounts is factored in.


## 8.2 The Travel Agent: Decline, Reinvention, and Renaissance

### The Original Distribution Channel

Before the internet, before the GDS, before revenue management—there were travel agents. For most of the twentieth century, the travel agent was the primary interface between the traveling public and the hospitality industry. Hotels distributed their inventory through printed rate sheets, phone reservations, and, beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, electronic reservation systems that evolved into the modern GDS. The travel agent was the human gatekeeper: the person who knew the hotels, understood the client's preferences, and made the booking. Airlines paid agents a standard 10 percent commission on every ticket sold. Hotels paid similar commissions. The economics were straightforward, the value proposition was clear, and the channel thrived.

At its peak in the late 1990s, the United States was home to approximately 33,000 travel agencies, employing hundreds of thousands of agents who collectively controlled the majority of leisure and business travel bookings (Phocuswright, 2024). The travel agent was not a niche channel—it was *the* channel.

### The Internet Disruption

The commercialization of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s triggered the most severe disruption the travel agency channel had ever faced. The launch of Expedia (1996), Travelocity (1996), and Priceline (1998) gave consumers direct access to the same inventory that travel agents had long intermediated—often at lower prices, with the convenience of booking from home at any hour.

Airlines struck the decisive blow. In 1995, Delta Air Lines capped agency commissions at $50 per round-trip ticket. Other airlines followed. By 2002, most major U.S. airlines had eliminated base commissions on domestic tickets entirely. The business model that had sustained tens of thousands of agencies—earning 10 percent on every airline ticket—evaporated in less than a decade.

The impact was devastating. The number of U.S. travel agencies declined sharply through the 2000s as thousands of storefront agencies shuttered. The agents who survived did so by pivoting: charging service fees directly to clients, specializing in complex itineraries that justified their expertise, or focusing on niches—luxury travel, cruises, destination weddings—where personal service commanded a premium.

### The Renaissance

The narrative of the travel agent as a dying breed proved premature. The American Society of Travel Advisors (ASTA) represents approximately 190,000 travel advisors in the United States as of 2024—roughly 100,000 of whom are full-time travel professionals worldwide—and the number is growing (ASTA, 2024; Ekstein, 2025). Phocuswright's research confirms that the U.S. travel agency market exceeded its 2019 value in 2024, grossing $110 billion in bookings in 2023 alone—a 28 percent year-over-year increase—and representing a remarkable recovery from the 74 percent plunge in agency bookings during 2020 (Phocuswright, 2024; Ekstein, 2025). Globally, travel agency revenue is projected to exceed $350 billion in 2025 (GlobalData, 2025).

Several forces are powering this resurgence. The COVID-19 pandemic reminded travelers of the value of having an expert advocate: when borders closed, flights were canceled, and refund policies changed daily, travelers who had booked through agents received personalized assistance, while those who had booked through OTAs were often left navigating automated customer service systems. The complexity of modern travel—vaccine requirements, visa regulations, sustainability considerations, overtourism at popular destinations—has increased demand for expert guidance. And a generational shift is underway: younger travelers, raised on algorithm-driven recommendations, are discovering the value of human curation.

Paradoxically, the rise of AI may be accelerating the advisor renaissance rather than threatening it. Adobe for Business reported a staggering 2,000 percent growth in AI-driven traffic to travel websites in the ten months following January 2025, and an Expedia Group survey found that 86 percent of 7,000 global travelers said they were eager to use AI to plan and book trips (Ekstein, 2025). Yet consumers who turn to ChatGPT for early-stage brainstorming often find it unreliable for detailed bookings—particularly in markets with less online data, where local relationships and insider knowledge matter most. As one industry observer put it, "You won't find the perks you get from travel agents on ChatGPT" (Ekstein, 2025). AI, it turns out, works best not as a replacement for human advisors but as a complement—handling data-intensive tasks like price monitoring and preference profiling while leaving taste, judgment, and relationship management to the human expert.

### From "Travel Agent" to "Travel Advisor"

The semantic shift from "travel agent" to "travel advisor" is more than branding. It reflects a fundamental change in the value proposition. The travel agent of the 1990s was a transaction processor: the client knew what they wanted, and the agent booked it. The travel advisor of the 2020s is an experience curator: the client describes how they want to *feel*, and the advisor designs an itinerary to deliver that feeling.

This shift has profound implications for hotels. An advisor-sourced booking is not just a reservation—it is a qualified recommendation from a trusted expert. The guest arrives with expectations that the advisor has set, stays longer because the itinerary was designed with intention, spends more on ancillary services because the advisor recommended them, and cancels less frequently because the commitment is personal, not transactional.

### Commission Structures

Hotels typically pay travel advisors a commission of 10 to 15 percent on room revenue, with luxury and resort properties often at the higher end. Many properties offer additional incentives: complimentary room upgrades, spa credits, food and beverage amenities, or welcome gifts for advisor-booked guests. These amenities cost the hotel relatively little but give the advisor a tangible benefit to offer their client—and a reason to recommend that property over a competitor.

Some hotel companies have reduced or restructured agent commissions in recent years, a shortsighted strategy that risks alienating the very intermediaries who deliver their highest-value guests. As we will explore in Section 8.6, the total cost of an advisor-sourced booking—even at a 15 percent commission—often compares favorably to OTA distribution when guest quality metrics are factored in.


## 8.3 The Modern Travel Advisor: Fora, Virtuoso, and the Curation Model

### Fora Travel: The Tech-Enabled Advisor

Fora Travel, founded in 2021, represents a fundamentally new model for the travel advisor industry. Rather than recruiting career travel agents, Fora actively targets professionals from adjacent industries—hospitality, media, technology, finance—who are passionate about travel and bring existing networks of potential clients. The company provides a proprietary technology platform that handles booking mechanics, commission tracking, supplier relationships, and client management, allowing advisors to focus on what they do best: curating experiences.

Fora's model addresses the two historical barriers to entering the travel advisor profession: technology infrastructure and supplier access. A new advisor joining Fora gains immediate access to preferred rates and amenities at hundreds of hotel properties through the company's consortium affiliations, without having to build those relationships independently over years. The platform handles commission payments, booking confirmations, and itinerary management through purpose-built software rather than the legacy systems that many traditional agencies still use.

The result is a rapidly growing network—now exceeding 10,000 travel advisors, whom Fora calls "travel designers"—who skew younger, more digitally fluent, and more socially connected than the traditional agency workforce. Many Fora advisors operate part-time, building their travel advisory practice alongside other careers—a flexibility that appeals to a demographic the traditional industry has struggled to attract (Travel Weekly, 2024; Ekstein, 2025).

Fora has also invested aggressively in AI tools that augment rather than replace its advisors. **Price Drop** is an in-house AI tool that constantly scans the GDS for drops in hotel rates and airfares already reserved for clients. When the system detects a lower price, it pings the advisor, who relays the opportunity to the client: "Would you like to rebook at the lower price, or upgrade to the suite for the same cost?" As co-founder Henley Vazquez explains, "Price Drop demonstrates that AI works best with human deployment" (Ekstein, 2025). In August 2025, Fora acquired **Legends**, an AI insights tool that scans clients' camera rolls and calendars (with opt-in consent) to extrapolate personality traits and travel preferences—enabling advisors to personalize recommendations without lengthy intake interviews. "No one wants a series of first dates where they have to keep explaining themselves to someone else," Vazquez says (Ekstein, 2025). The underlying philosophy is that AI handles data processing while the advisor provides taste and judgment: "You can go to ChatGPT and get a list of luxury hotels, no problem. But taste is where technology fails" (Ekstein, 2025).

### Virtuoso: The Luxury Network

If Fora represents the new frontier, Virtuoso represents the established apex of the advisor channel. Virtuoso is a by-invitation-only network of luxury travel agencies and advisors, with approximately 20,000 advisors across more than 50 countries. The network's collective purchasing power is enormous: Virtuoso maintains a data warehouse encompassing $90 billion in transaction data, giving it unparalleled insight into luxury travel patterns and preferences (Virtuoso, 2025).

The network's recent performance underscores the strength of the luxury advisor channel. In the first half of 2025, Virtuoso reported a 12 percent increase in total sales year-over-year, with hotel sales surging 26 percent. Bookings exceeding $50,000 in value grew 35 percent—a clear signal that ultra-high-net-worth travelers are increasingly relying on advisors for complex, high-stakes travel (Virtuoso, 2025). These are not price-sensitive bookings. They are relationship-driven purchases where the advisor's recommendation carries decisive weight.

Virtuoso's hotel program offers participating properties access to this high-value clientele in exchange for providing confirmed amenities—typically a room upgrade at booking (subject to availability), complimentary breakfast, a property credit (often $100 or more), early check-in and late checkout, and a welcome amenity. For hotels, the math is straightforward: the cost of these amenities is modest compared to the ADR and ancillary revenue that Virtuoso guests generate.

### Embark Beyond: AI-Powered Clientelling

Fora is not alone in deploying AI to enhance advisor capabilities. Jack Ezon's Embark Beyond, a luxury travel consultancy with 350 travel consultants, has invested nearly $3 million in an AI-powered "clientelling" tool that matches ultra-high-net-worth clients to properties based on specific interests—art, wellness, gastronomy, adventure. The tool continuously scans supplier inventories and notifies agents when new experiences are added or client profiles are updated, ensuring that recommendations remain current and precisely tailored (Ekstein, 2025). Where Fora's AI tools focus on price optimization and preference learning, Embark Beyond's investment illustrates how AI can deepen the matching function that defines the advisor's core value.

### Other Major Networks

Virtuoso and Fora are not the only players. Several other advisor networks and consortia shape the landscape:

**Signature Travel Network** operates as a cooperative of member agencies, providing marketing support, preferred supplier relationships, and technology tools. Its members range from large multi-location agencies to independent advisors, and the network's hotel program mirrors Virtuoso's in structure if not in luxury positioning.

**Internova Travel Group** is one of the largest travel companies in North America, operating brands including Travel Leaders Group and Nexion Travel Group. Internova's scale gives it significant negotiating leverage with hotel suppliers, and its franchise model supports thousands of affiliated advisors.

**Ensemble Travel Group** is a Canadian-headquartered consortium with a strong presence in both the United States and Canada, offering its member agencies preferred supplier programs, marketing resources, and technology platforms.

Each of these networks provides hotels with access to a different segment of the advisor-sourced market, and sophisticated hotel distribution strategies involve participating in multiple consortia programs to maximize reach across the advisor channel.

### Why Hotels Value Advisor-Sourced Bookings

The data consistently shows that guests booked through travel advisors outperform other indirect channels on virtually every metric that matters to hotels:

**Higher ADR.** Advisor clients tend to book higher room categories and are less price-sensitive than OTA guests, who are often comparison-shopping on price. The advisor's recommendation shifts the purchase decision from "which hotel is cheapest?" to "which hotel is the best fit?"

**Longer Length of Stay.** Advisors design itineraries with intentionality, often recommending that clients spend sufficient time at each destination to experience it fully. This translates to longer stays compared to the quick business trips that dominate other channels or the weekend getaways common on OTAs.

**More ancillary spend.** Advisors actively recommend on-property experiences—spa treatments, restaurant reservations, excursion bookings—as part of the itinerary. The guest arrives primed to spend beyond the room rate.

**Lower cancellation rates.** The personal relationship between advisor and client creates commitment. Canceling a booking made through a trusted advisor feels different from canceling an anonymous OTA reservation—there is social friction, and the advisor can intervene to modify rather than cancel when plans change.

**Lower acquisition cost than OTAs.** While a 10–15 percent commission may seem comparable to OTA commission rates, the advisor channel does not demand rate parity, does not commoditize the product, does not own the guest relationship, and does not up-sell competitor properties at the point of booking. The hotel retains far more control over its brand presentation and pricing in the advisor channel than on any OTA platform.

### The Advisor as a "Human Direct Channel"

The most compelling way to understand the travel advisor's value to hotels is to think of the advisor as a **human direct channel**. Like a hotel's own website, the advisor presents the property in context, communicates its unique value proposition, and delivers a guest who has been qualified and matched to the property. Unlike the hotel's website, the advisor does this through personal conversation rather than digital marketing—and does so with a credibility that no banner ad or retargeting campaign can replicate.

When a trusted advisor tells a client, "This is the right hotel for you," that recommendation carries the weight of the advisor's professional reputation. Hotels that invest in advisor relationships are investing in a distribution channel that combines qualified demand generation, personalized guest matching, and brand-aligned presentation—at a cost that is transparent, commission-based, and directly tied to actualized revenue.


## 8.4 Travel Management Companies and Corporate Distribution

### What TMCs Do

A Travel Management Company is a specialized firm that manages the end-to-end travel program for corporate clients. TMCs serve as the operational backbone of business travel, performing functions that extend far beyond simple booking:

**Rate negotiation.** TMCs aggregate the travel volume of their corporate clients to negotiate preferred rates with hotel companies—often 10 to 30 percent below published rates—through a structured Request for Proposal (RFP) process conducted annually.

**Policy enforcement.** Corporate travel policies—rules governing which hotels employees may book, maximum nightly rates by city, advance booking requirements—are encoded into the TMC's booking platform. When an employee searches for a hotel, the system surfaces compliant options and flags or blocks non-compliant ones.

**Duty of care.** In an era of geopolitical instability, natural disasters, and health emergencies, corporations have a legal and ethical obligation to know where their traveling employees are and to assist them in emergencies. TMCs provide real-time traveler tracking, risk alerts, and emergency assistance through their platforms—functionality that relies on centralized booking data, much of it flowing through the GDS.

**Expense management.** TMCs integrate with corporate expense reporting systems, automating the reconciliation of travel costs and providing finance teams with consolidated data on travel spending by department, traveler, destination, and supplier.

**Data and analytics.** TMCs provide corporate travel managers with detailed reporting on program performance: hotel spend by market, compliance rates, average rates achieved versus negotiated rates, traveler satisfaction, and supplier performance.

### The Big Three—Soon the Big Two

The TMC industry has historically been dominated by three global players:

**American Express Global Business Travel (Amex GBT)** is the world's largest TMC, with European sales alone exceeding €10.2 billion. Formed as a joint venture between American Express and a consortium of investors in 2014, Amex GBT went public via a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger in 2022. The company serves multinational corporations across every major market and operates one of the most sophisticated technology platforms in the industry.

**BCD Travel**, privately held and headquartered in Utrecht, Netherlands, is the second-largest global TMC with approximately €6.4 billion in European sales. BCD has built a reputation for operational excellence and a technology-forward approach, including its proprietary TripSource platform.

**CWT** (formerly Carlson Wagonlit Travel) was the third of the global TMCs, with approximately €4 billion in European sales. CWT served major corporate and government clients and operated its own booking and expense management platforms.

The operative word is "was." In 2025, Amex GBT completed its acquisition of CWT for $570 million—a deal that had been announced in 2024 and cleared regulatory review after scrutiny from competition authorities in multiple jurisdictions. The combined entity is expected to realize approximately $155 million in annual cost synergies, primarily through technology platform consolidation and operational efficiencies (Amex GBT, 2025). The Big Three became the Big Two, a consolidation with significant implications for hotels that we explore in this chapter's Industry Spotlight.

### Tech Disruptors

The TMC landscape is no longer defined solely by the incumbents. A new generation of technology-first companies is challenging the traditional model:

**Navan** (formerly TripActions) is the most prominent disruptor. Founded in 2015 and rebranded in 2023, Navan built a consumer-grade booking experience for corporate travel—an interface that feels more like booking on a modern OTA than navigating a legacy TMC platform. The company went public in 2025 at $25 per share, validating its technology-forward approach and signaling investor confidence in the modernization of corporate travel (Navan, 2025). Navan's platform integrates travel booking, expense management, and corporate card services into a single ecosystem, reducing friction for both travelers and travel managers.

**TravelPerk**, headquartered in Barcelona, targets small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)—a segment historically underserved by the global TMCs, which focused on large enterprise clients. TravelPerk's platform emphasizes ease of use, flexible cancellation policies, and a self-service model that requires minimal administrative overhead.

**Spotnana** takes a different approach entirely, offering a travel-as-a-service platform that TMCs and corporations can white-label and customize. Rather than competing directly with incumbent TMCs, Spotnana provides the underlying technology infrastructure that powers modern travel management—a platform play rather than a service play.

These disruptors are not replacing the global TMCs so much as expanding the market: bringing modern travel management tools to organizations that were previously too small or too cost-conscious to engage a traditional TMC.

### How Corporate Hotel Programs Work

The corporate hotel procurement process revolves around the annual Request for Proposal. Each year, corporate travel managers (often working with their TMC) identify the markets where their employees travel most frequently, analyze historical booking data, and issue RFPs to hotel properties in those markets. The RFP process typically unfolds as follows:

1. **Data analysis.** The corporation reviews its travel patterns by city—how many room nights in New York, Chicago, London, Singapore—and identifies properties that have historically received its business.

2. **RFP issuance.** The travel manager sends RFPs to hotels in target markets, requesting proposals for negotiated rates. The RFP specifies the corporation's expected volume in that market, preferred room types, and required amenities.

3. **Hotel response.** Hotels respond with proposed rates, typically 10–30 percent below their Best Available Rate (BAR), along with value-added benefits such as complimentary breakfast, Wi-Fi, and loyalty point earning on negotiated-rate stays.

4. **Negotiation and selection.** The travel manager evaluates proposals, negotiates further where warranted, and selects preferred hotels in each market. Selected properties are loaded into the corporation's travel program as "preferred" suppliers.

5. **Rate loading.** Negotiated rates are loaded into the GDS and the TMC's booking platform, ensuring that employees see preferred hotel options when searching for accommodations.

6. **Last Room Availability (LRA).** A critical component of many corporate agreements, LRA requires the hotel to honor the negotiated rate as long as it has any standard room available for sale—even during high-demand periods. LRA provides the corporation with rate certainty and the hotel with volume commitment, but it can create tension during compression periods when the hotel would prefer to sell at higher transient rates.

7. **Performance review.** At the end of each year (or quarterly), the travel manager reviews hotel performance—actual room nights versus committed volume, rate compliance, guest satisfaction—and uses this data to inform the next RFP cycle.

### The Scale of Corporate Travel

The Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) estimates that global business travel spending reached $1.57 trillion in 2025, reflecting a full recovery from the pandemic and continued growth driven by international travel resumption and increased meeting and event activity (GBTA, 2025). Within the average business trip, lodging is the single largest expense category, accounting for approximately $312 of the $1,128 average domestic trip cost—more than airfare, ground transportation, or meals (GBTA, 2025).

Corporate travel volumes continue to grow. In GBTA surveys, 71 percent of travel buyers reported increased bookings in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by a combination of economic growth, return-to-office mandates that increased the need for inter-office travel, and a resurgence in client-facing travel that had been curtailed during the pandemic era (GBTA, 2025).

### Self-Booking Tools and the Shift to Employee Self-Service

The traditional model of corporate travel—call the TMC, speak with an agent, have them make the booking—has given way to employee self-service. Modern TMC platforms provide online booking tools (OBTs) that allow employees to search, compare, and book hotels themselves, within the guardrails of their company's travel policy. The system handles policy compliance automatically: if an employee searches for hotels in San Francisco, the OBT surfaces preferred properties first, flags rates that exceed the city's per-diem cap, and routes exceptions through an approval workflow.

This shift to self-service has reduced TMC operating costs (fewer agent-assisted transactions), increased employee satisfaction (travelers prefer the autonomy of booking their own hotels), and improved data capture (every self-booked transaction flows through the TMC platform, providing complete visibility). The trade-off is complexity: OBTs must aggregate content from multiple sources—GDS, direct hotel connections, sometimes OTA content—to ensure that employees see the broadest possible selection of compliant options. Hotels that are not properly connected to these systems risk being invisible to millions of corporate travelers.


## 8.5 The GDS Under Pressure: NDC and the Future

### The Airline Side: NDC's Disruption

New Distribution Capability (NDC) is an XML-based data transmission standard developed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) that allows airlines to distribute rich content—bundled fares, ancillary products, personalized offers—directly to travel sellers, bypassing the traditional GDS infrastructure. NDC was designed to address airlines' long-standing frustration with GDS economics: airlines paid GDS operators billions in distribution fees annually, and the decades-old Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport (EDIFACT) messaging standard that underpins GDS airline content could not support the merchandising capabilities that airlines wanted.

The impact on air distribution has been significant. NDC fares are approximately 8 percent cheaper than equivalent GDS fares, reflecting both the airlines' reduced distribution costs—estimated at 40 percent lower than EDIFACT-based distribution—and the airlines' willingness to incentivize NDC adoption through pricing (Rizvi, 2025). Several major carriers have gone further, imposing surcharges on bookings made through the GDS rather than through NDC or direct channels. Lufthansa Group led this trend with a €16 surcharge in 2015, and Qantas and Turkish Airlines have followed with similar measures.

The result is a measurable erosion of GDS economics on the air side. Air distribution revenues at both Amadeus and Sabre remained below 2019 levels through 2024, even as travel volumes recovered (Rizvi, 2025). More than 60 percent of corporate travelers report preferring to book flights directly with airlines—a preference that NDC-enabled direct connections are increasingly designed to accommodate.

### The Hotel Side: Stability Amid Disruption

The hotel GDS market tells a fundamentally different story. Unlike airlines, which have invested heavily in direct distribution technology and view the GDS as an expensive intermediary to be disintermediated, hotels have not mounted a comparable assault on GDS distribution. Several factors explain this divergence.

First, hotel content is inherently more complex and variable than airline content. A flight from New York to London has a clear departure time, arrival time, and seat configuration. A hotel room in London varies by property, room type, view, floor, bed configuration, and dozens of amenity variables. The GDS handles this complexity through standardized content fields that travel agents understand and can compare—a function that has not been disrupted by a hotel-specific equivalent of NDC.

Second, the corporate travel use case for hotel GDS bookings is deeply entrenched. Corporate rate programs, duty-of-care tracking, and TMC platform integration all depend on GDS connectivity. Disrupting this would require coordinated action across hotels, TMCs, and corporate buyers—a level of industry alignment that has not materialized.

Third, GDS operators have recognized that hotel distribution is an increasingly important revenue stream as airline revenues decline, and they have invested accordingly in hotel-specific features, content capabilities, and connectivity solutions. For Amadeus and Sabre, the hotel GDS is not a legacy business to be defended—it is a growth business to be cultivated.

### Agency Bookings: A Growth Trajectory

Skift Research projects that agency bookings—inclusive of both GDS and non-GDS advisor channels—will grow 125 percent by 2030, a trajectory that reflects both the recovery of corporate travel and the expansion of the advisor-booked leisure market (Skift Research, 2024a). This growth estimate may seem aggressive, but it is grounded in observable trends: the return of business travel spending, the advisor renaissance documented in Section 8.2, and the increasing complexity of travel that drives demand for expert intermediation.

### The Bleisure Factor

One trend extending the relevance of GDS-sourced bookings is the rise of bleisure travel—the practice of adding leisure days to business trips. The bleisure tourism market is growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 19.5 percent and is projected to reach $4.2 trillion by 2034 (Future Market Insights, 2025). For hotels, bleisure travel means that a corporate GDS booking that begins as a two-night business stay extends into a four- or five-night stay with leisure spending on weekends. The initial booking enters through the GDS at a negotiated corporate rate, but the extended nights often convert to higher leisure rates with ancillary spending on dining, spa, and activities. The GDS serves as the entry point for a guest whose total economic value far exceeds the original corporate reservation.


## 8.6 Hotel Strategy: Optimizing the GDS and Agent Channels

### When the GDS Makes Strategic Sense

Not every hotel benefits equally from GDS distribution. The channel delivers the highest return for properties with the following characteristics:

**Strong corporate demand.** Properties in urban business districts, near corporate campuses, or adjacent to convention centers—where corporate travelers constitute a significant share of demand—are natural fits for GDS distribution. The channel's skew toward business travel (87 percent of GDS hotel reservations) means that properties without meaningful corporate demand are paying for access to a channel that does not serve their primary market.

**Upper-midscale to luxury positioning.** The cost structure of GDS distribution—$5–12 in transaction fees plus 8–10 percent commission—requires sufficient ADR to absorb these costs while maintaining acceptable margins. A property with a $250 ADR paying a total of 18 percent in GDS distribution costs nets approximately $205—a reasonable outcome. A property with a $95 ADR paying the same percentage nets $78, leaving far less margin for operations and profit.

**Airport and transit locations.** Business travelers making last-minute bookings near airports are among the heaviest users of GDS-connected booking tools. Properties in these locations benefit disproportionately from GDS visibility.

**International visibility needs.** For properties seeking to attract guests from markets where OTA penetration is lower or where travel agents remain the dominant booking channel—parts of Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East—the GDS provides reach that direct-channel marketing alone cannot achieve.

### When It Does Not

**Pure leisure and resort properties** in destinations where corporate travel is minimal may find that GDS costs exceed the channel's value. A beachfront resort in Tulum whose guest base is overwhelmingly leisure travelers booked through OTAs, advisors, or direct channels gains little from maintaining GDS connectivity—though consortium participation for the advisor channel may still be warranted.

**Budget and economy hotels** whose ADR cannot absorb GDS distribution costs are better served by OTA channels (where commission is the primary cost, without layered transaction fees) or direct booking strategies.

**Properties in markets with low GDS penetration** should evaluate whether the volume of GDS-sourced bookings justifies the fixed costs of connectivity and content maintenance.

### Best Practices for GDS Optimization

Hotels that participate in the GDS should treat it as a managed distribution channel requiring ongoing investment and attention:

**Maintain accurate, compelling GDS content.** The hotel's GDS listing is its storefront for hundreds of thousands of travel agents and corporate booking tools. Descriptions should be current, amenity lists complete, and images high-quality. D-EDGE's research consistently shows that properties with rich GDS content outperform those with minimal or outdated listings (D-EDGE, 2024).

**Participate in consortia programs.** Virtuoso, Signature, Internova, Ensemble, and other consortia represent the advisor channel's organized buying power. Participating in these programs—agreeing to provide specified amenities for consortium-booked guests—gives the hotel visibility in advisor searches and preferred positioning in the networks' booking platforms.

**Monitor RFP win rates.** For properties competing for corporate accounts, tracking the percentage of RFPs won, the rates offered versus rates achieved, and the actual room nights delivered against commitments provides essential data for optimizing the corporate distribution strategy.

**Track channel performance holistically.** GDS distribution costs should not be evaluated in isolation. Compare the GDS guest's total revenue contribution—room revenue, ancillary spend, repeat visits, length of stay, cancellation rate—against other channels. The channel with the lowest commission rate is not necessarily the channel with the highest net revenue per guest.

### Commission Management and Agent Incentive Programs

Smart commission management is a distribution strategy, not merely an accounting function. Hotels should consider:

**Tiered commission structures** that reward high-performing agents or agencies with higher commission rates or bonus payments when volume thresholds are met.

**Preferred agent amenity programs** that provide agents' clients with tangible benefits—room upgrades, property credits, welcome amenities—at minimal cost to the hotel, incentivizing the agent to recommend the property.

**Agent familiarization (FAM) trips** that bring high-potential advisors to the property to experience it firsthand. An advisor who has personally stayed at a hotel recommends it with conviction that no brochure or website can replicate.

**Prompt commission payment.** Few things damage a hotel's relationship with the advisor community faster than slow or unreliable commission payments. Properties that pay commissions promptly and accurately build a reputation in the advisor community that translates directly to bookings.

### The Strategic Case for Advisor Investment

In a distribution landscape dominated by OTA debate—rate parity, commission rates, billboard effects—the travel advisor channel offers hotels something increasingly rare: a high-value, relationship-driven distribution channel where the hotel retains control over its brand presentation, pricing, and guest relationship.

Consider the comparison. An OTA booking delivers a guest who was likely comparison-shopping on price, whose loyalty is to the OTA platform rather than the hotel brand, and whose data is controlled by the OTA. An advisor booking delivers a guest who was personally recommended to the hotel by a trusted expert, who arrives with expectations the advisor has set and the hotel can fulfill, and whose relationship the hotel can cultivate directly.

The total distribution cost may be similar—15 to 22 percent for GDS/advisor versus 15 to 25 percent for OTAs—but the quality of the guest and the retention of the relationship are profoundly different. Hotels that invest in advisor relationships are investing in a distribution channel that functions as an extension of their own sales team: identifying the right guest, matching them to the right property, and delivering them with context and commitment.


## Industry Spotlight: The Amex GBT–CWT Merger and the Future of Corporate Travel

In 2025, American Express Global Business Travel completed its acquisition of CWT (formerly Carlson Wagonlit Travel) for $570 million, creating the largest TMC in history by a considerable margin. The deal, announced in 2024, required regulatory clearance in multiple jurisdictions—a process that reflected the competitive significance of combining the first and third largest global TMCs.

### Two Companies, One Logic

Both Amex GBT and CWT had built their businesses on the same fundamental model: aggregating the travel spending of large corporations to negotiate preferred supplier rates, providing technology platforms for booking and expense management, and delivering duty-of-care and traveler-tracking capabilities. The merger's logic was primarily operational: combining two companies with overlapping technology platforms, supplier relationships, and corporate client bases could yield approximately $155 million in annual cost synergies through platform consolidation and headcount rationalization (Amex GBT, 2025).

### What This Means for Hotels

For hotel companies, the consolidation of the TMC landscape from three global players to two raises important strategic questions.

**Increased buyer leverage.** The combined Amex GBT–CWT entity controls a larger share of corporate hotel bookings than any single TMC has ever held. In RFP negotiations, this translates to greater leverage: the ability to demand deeper discounts, more favorable cancellation terms, and additional value-adds as conditions of preferred status. Hotels—particularly independent properties and smaller brands without significant counter-leverage—may find negotiations more challenging.

**Technology platform convergence.** The merged company will eventually operate a single technology platform, requiring hotels to maintain connectivity and content accuracy on that unified system. For hotels already connected to both legacy platforms, this simplifies operations; for those connected to only one, migration will be necessary.

**Data consolidation.** The merged entity will possess a broader and deeper dataset on corporate travel patterns than any predecessor company. This data advantage could enable more sophisticated negotiation strategies, benchmarking tools, and demand forecasting—capabilities that serve the TMC's corporate clients but may put hotel negotiators at an informational disadvantage.

### The Disruptor Counterweight

The consolidation at the top of the TMC market is occurring simultaneously with the emergence of technology-forward disruptors at the bottom and middle. Navan's 2025 IPO validated the market's appetite for modern corporate travel platforms, and TravelPerk's rapid growth in the SME segment demonstrates that the traditional TMC model is not the only viable approach.

For hotels, this creates a dual dynamic. On one hand, fewer mega-TMCs mean more concentrated negotiating power among the largest corporate buyers. On the other hand, the proliferation of tech-forward platforms means more channels through which corporate travelers discover and book hotels—some of which may operate outside the traditional GDS infrastructure entirely.

The tension between scale and agility will define the next decade of corporate travel distribution. Amex GBT's bet is that scale wins: that the largest corporations want a single, global TMC with comprehensive capabilities. Navan's bet is that agility wins: that modern travelers demand a consumer-grade booking experience, and that the technology platform matters more than the legacy service model. Hotels must be prepared for both futures—maintaining robust GDS connectivity and TMC relationships while ensuring their inventory is accessible through the emerging platforms that are reshaping how corporate travelers search, compare, and book.


## Chapter Summary

The GDS, travel advisor, and TMC channels represent some of the oldest and most enduring forms of hotel distribution—and, paradoxically, some of the most dynamic. The GDS, a technology built in the mainframe era, surpassed its pre-pandemic booking peak in 2024 and continues to deliver the highest-quality indirect bookings in the industry: high ADR, low cancellation, long length of stay. Travel advisors, whom the internet was supposed to eliminate, have reinvented themselves as experience curators whose recommendations carry the weight of personal trust and professional expertise. TMCs, the backbone of corporate travel distribution, are consolidating at the top while being disrupted from below by technology-native platforms.

For hotel distribution strategists, these channels demand a nuanced approach. The GDS is not a universal solution—it is most valuable for properties with significant corporate demand and sufficient ADR to absorb its cost structure. The advisor channel is not a relic—it is a human direct channel that delivers qualified, high-value guests with lower acquisition costs than OTAs. The TMC relationship is not merely a procurement exercise—it is a strategic partnership that determines a property's access to billions of dollars in managed corporate travel spending.

The common thread across all three channels is intermediation with expertise. Unlike the OTA, which intermediates through technology and scale, the GDS intermediates through infrastructure, the advisor intermediates through curation, and the TMC intermediates through aggregation and policy management. Each creates value for both the hotel and the guest—and each demands strategic investment to optimize.

**What's Next:** Chapter 9 turns to the largest and most debated intermediary in hotel distribution—the Online Travel Agency.

## Discussion Questions

1. **Channel economics comparison.** A 300-room urban hotel has an ADR of $225. Calculate the approximate net revenue per booking from: (a) a direct website booking with a 5 percent marketing cost, (b) a GDS booking with a $10 transaction fee and 10 percent agent commission, and (c) an OTA booking with an 18 percent commission. Beyond the per-booking math, what qualitative factors should the revenue manager consider when evaluating these channels?

2. **The advisor value proposition.** A luxury resort pays travel advisors a 15 percent commission—higher than its 18 percent OTA commission rate on a percentage basis. Under what circumstances might the resort's general manager argue that the advisor channel is *less expensive* than the OTA channel despite the higher commission rate? What metrics would support this argument?

3. **Corporate RFP strategy.** You are the director of sales at a 250-room full-service hotel near a major airport. A Fortune 500 company's TMC sends you an RFP requesting a negotiated rate that is 25 percent below your BAR, with Last Room Availability. What factors do you evaluate in deciding whether to accept, counter, or decline? How does the LRA provision specifically affect your revenue management during compression periods?

4. **The GDS relevance debate.** Some industry commentators argue that the GDS is a legacy technology that will be displaced by direct connections between hotels and corporate booking platforms. Others argue that the GDS remains indispensable for corporate travel distribution. Which position do you find more persuasive, and what evidence from this chapter supports your view?

5. **TMC consolidation impact.** Following the Amex GBT–CWT merger, a hotel chain's VP of Global Sales is concerned about the combined TMC's increased negotiating leverage. What strategic responses could the hotel chain consider to maintain its bargaining position? How might the emergence of Navan, TravelPerk, and other disruptors affect the competitive dynamics?

6. **Channel strategy for an independent hotel.** An independent 80-room boutique hotel in a mid-sized European city is evaluating whether to invest in GDS connectivity and consortia participation. The property's current distribution is 40 percent OTA, 35 percent direct, 15 percent wholesale, and 10 percent other. Develop a recommendation: Should this property add GDS distribution? Which consortia should it prioritize? What would you expect the channel mix to look like two years after implementation?
