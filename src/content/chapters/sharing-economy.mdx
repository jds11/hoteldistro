title: "The Sharing Economy"

## Opening Vignette

On a Tuesday morning in March 2023, Maria Torres—director of revenue management for a 200-room boutique hotel in Barcelona's Eixample district—opened her competitive intelligence dashboard and paused. Her comp set had changed. Alongside the four branded hotels she had tracked for years, her revenue management system now displayed pricing data from 127 nearby Airbnb listings: professionally managed apartments, many offering two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a balcony for €30 less per night than her entry-level room. Three of those listings were operated by the same property management company, which had furnished them to boutique-hotel standards and maintained a 4.9-star average across 400+ reviews.

Torres's challenge was no longer simply beating the Hilton down the street on rate and occupancy. She was competing against an entirely different category of accommodation—one that did not exist a decade earlier, operated under different regulatory rules, and was listed on a platform with 7.7 million properties worldwide.

Her predicament captures the central tension of this chapter: how the sharing economy transformed hospitality distribution, who won, who adapted, and what it means for the professionals who must navigate this reshaped competitive landscape.

## 12.1 The Rise of the Sharing Economy in Travel

### Defining the Sharing Economy

The sharing economy—also termed the collaborative economy or platform economy—refers to economic systems in which individuals share access to assets, resources, or services through digital platforms. In travel, this concept reshaped the short-term rental market, enabling homeowners and tenants to rent spare rooms, entire apartments, or vacation homes to travelers via online marketplaces (Zervas et al., 2017).

The concept was not entirely new. Vacation Rental by Owner (VRBO) had operated since 1995, and home-swapping services predated the internet. But the convergence of four forces in the late 2000s created conditions for explosive growth:

*   **Smartphone proliferation.** Mobile devices enabled listing, discovery, and booking from anywhere, collapsing the friction of peer-to-peer transactions.
*   **Trust infrastructure.** Two-sided rating systems, identity verification, and secure payment processing reduced the perceived risk of staying in a stranger's home. Research has demonstrated that profile photos and review scores significantly influence booking decisions on peer-to-peer platforms, effectively digitizing the trust required for hospitality (Ert, Fleischer, & Magen, 2016).
*   **Post-recession economics.** The 2008 financial crisis—the same year Airbnb was founded (GlobalData, 2024)—left homeowners seeking supplemental income and travelers seeking affordable alternatives. Between 2008 and 2012, U.S. median household income fell 8.3% in real terms (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013), creating both supply-side motivation and demand-side price sensitivity.
*   **Generational preferences.** Millennial travelers expressed stronger preferences for "authentic" and "local" experiences over standardized hospitality. This behavioral shift allowed platforms like Airbnb to act as a disruptive innovation in the classic Christensen tradition, initially capturing low-end market segments before moving upmarket (Guttentag, 2015).

### Airbnb's Growth Trajectory

Airbnb's arc from a 2008 experiment—three air mattresses in a San Francisco apartment rented to design conference attendees at $80 per night—to a publicly traded company valued above $80 billion constitutes one of the most dramatic growth stories in modern business.

The financial trajectory demonstrates both the platform's operating leverage and the maturation of its business model. Its take rate—the percentage of gross booking value retained as revenue—averaged approximately 14% in 2023, split between host service fees and guest service fees (Airbnb, 2024a).

### How Airbnb Changed Distribution

From a distribution perspective, Airbnb's impact was multidimensional:

**New supply entered the market.** Millions of properties that had never been part of formal hospitality supply became bookable. This expanded the total addressable market by making inventory available in residential neighborhoods, rural areas, and unconventional property types that hotels had never served.

**The definition of "accommodation" expanded.** Travelers began evaluating hotel rooms against entire apartments and villas. For families and groups, the per-person economics of a three-bedroom apartment frequently undercut even midscale hotels.

**Consumer expectations shifted.** Airbnb popularized the notion that travel accommodation should feel personal and local. As CEO Brian Chesky articulated in 2014: "We do not want people to travel like tourists. We want them to travel like they live there" (Gallagher, 2017, p. 112). This framing reshaped marketing language across the entire industry.

**A new distribution channel emerged for professional operators.** As Airbnb matured, professional property managers began listing alongside individual hosts. This raised a critical question: is Airbnb still a sharing economy platform, or has it become a lodging corporation? Research indicates that multi-unit, professionally managed listings increasingly compete directly with hotels (Dogru, Mody, Suess, Line, & Bonn, 2020). Furthermore, these multi-unit commercial listings have a measurably greater negative impact on hotel revenues than true peer-to-peer single-unit listings (Dogru, Mody, Line, & Hanks, 2022).

### Airbnb's Own Distribution Strategy

For a distribution textbook, it is vital to examine how Airbnb itself acquires supply and demand. 

On the **demand side**, Airbnb has built one of the most powerful organic search presences in travel. Its structural advantage lies in its organic reach. Historically, only about 23 percent of the platform's traffic has come from paid search—a fraction of the billions spent by OTAs like Booking Holdings and Expedia Group (Borko & Geerts, 2020). The company spent $1.8 billion on sales and marketing in 2023, but notably shifted from performance marketing (paid search, metasearch) toward brand campaigns, arguing that brand marketing delivers higher long-term returns (Airbnb, 2024a). Further aiding this organic strength, 69 percent of Airbnb's revenue comes from repeat customers, indicating strong brand loyalty without a formal points-based loyalty program.

On the **supply side**, Airbnb invests heavily in host recruitment and retention. The platform's ability to attract and retain hosts is its most critical competitive advantage. An estimated 90 percent of Airbnb's listings originate from individual or "mom and pop" micro-entrepreneurs who rarely cross-list on competing platforms, creating a highly defensible supply moat (Borko & Geerts, 2020). The sheer scale of this ecosystem became evident prior to the pandemic, when the platform generated an estimated 317 million room nights sold at an average daily rate of $118, yielding gross bookings of $37.4 billion (Borko & Geerts, 2020). Notably, the platform's effective occupancy rate for active listings hovers around 19 percent—structurally lower than the hotel industry's 30+ percent, reflecting the seasonal, part-time nature of much sharing-economy supply.

### Airbnb's Strategic Pivot: "Hotels, Hotels, Hotels"

In a dramatic shift that highlights the convergence of the sharing economy and traditional hospitality, Airbnb has recently made a major strategic pivot toward hotel distribution. In early 2026, the company elevated Jesse Stein to a newly created **"head of hotels"** role and hired Lou Zameryka from Booking.com as **"global head, hotel enterprise and connectivity partnerships."** The company also added Jim Alderman, former CEO of Radisson Americas, to its business development team.

This strategic shift reflects both regulatory pressure and market maturation. As Chesky stated: "We are now getting serious about hotels" (Schaal, 2025b). When home-sharing becomes legally constrained in major cities, hotels offer an alternative inventory source to maintain growth. This places Airbnb in direct competition with traditional OTAs, fundamentally altering the channel landscape for hotel revenue managers.

---

### 🛑 Check Your Understanding: Platform Economics
**Scenario:** You are the asset manager for a portfolio of 50 luxury vacation villas. You currently distribute exclusively through a traditional OTA that charges a 15% commission on the gross booking value, but you are considering shifting inventory to Airbnb. Airbnb charges a 3% host fee, but adds an 11% guest service fee at checkout. 
**Question:** From a pure distribution cost perspective, does moving to Airbnb save you money? 
**Analysis:** While the *host* fee is lower (3% vs 15%), the total *take rate* extracted from the transaction is nearly identical (14% vs 15%). The guest pays the 11% fee, which increases the final price they see. To maintain the same competitive final price to the consumer, you may have to lower your base rate on Airbnb. Distribution professionals must analyze the *total platform take rate*, not just the host commission, when evaluating channel costs.

## 12.2 The Impact on Traditional Hotels

### Measuring the Disruption

Early empirical research confirmed what hoteliers suspected: Airbnb's market entry produces measurable effects on hotel performance. The picture, however, is highly nuanced across three dimensions:

*   **Segment matters.** Luxury and upper-upscale hotels have been less affected than economy and midscale properties. Business hotels with strong corporate contracts remain relatively insulated, while leisure-oriented properties in tourist destinations face the greatest competitive pressure (Dogru, Mody, & Suess, 2020). Furthermore, smaller, independently operated properties are disproportionately affected, lacking the brand recognition and loyalty programs that buffer chain-affiliated competitors (Destefanis, Neirotti, & Paolucci, 2022).
*   **Market conditions matter.** During low-demand periods, when travelers are most price-sensitive, the competitive impact intensifies (Zervas, Proserpio, & Byers, 2017). Conversely, during peak-demand periods, Airbnb functions primarily as overflow capacity, providing a "capacity-smoothing" effect that benefits consumers when hotel constraints would otherwise drive rates exponentially higher (Farronato & Fradkin, 2022).
*   **Geography matters.** In cities with constrained hotel supply and high average daily rates—New York, San Francisco, London, Paris—Airbnb's impact has been most pronounced. In markets with abundant, affordable hotel inventory, the substitution effect is smaller.

### Market Share and Maturation

By 2024, short-term rentals accounted for an estimated 20–25% of the global accommodation market by revenue, up from approximately 10% in 2015 (Phocuswright, 2024). However, sizing this market accurately requires strong data literacy, as different research firms use different methodologies.

</table>
*Analytical Takeaway:* When evaluating market share, distribution professionals must check the denominator (Global vs. U.S. total accommodations) and the definition of the numerator (Does it include hostels? Serviced apartments? Only peer-to-peer?). 

Importantly, the growth trajectory is moderating. After explosive expansion, Airbnb's year-over-year revenue growth decelerated from 77% in 2022 to 18% in 2023 (Airbnb, 2024a), suggesting market maturation. Supply growth has also slowed in many urban markets as regulatory constraints take effect.

## 12.3 The Hotel Industry Fights Back

The hotel industry's response to sharing economy competition has been more aggressive and strategic than early skeptics predicted. Major chains have adapted their distribution strategies to compete on—and in some cases co-opt—the sharing economy's own terms. 

Research assessing Airbnb as a disruptive innovation found that while a significant segment of users would have stayed in hotels absent the platform (confirming direct substitution), Airbnb's appeal was driven primarily by practical attributes like price and space rather than the "authentic local experience" narrative. This suggested that hotels' competitive response should focus on value and amenity differentiation as much as experiential positioning (Guttentag & Smith, 2017).

### Lifestyle and Boutique Brands

Recognizing that sharing economy travelers were drawn to uniqueness and local character, major hotel companies launched or acquired lifestyle brands designed to feel less corporate:

*   **Marriott** acquired Starwood in 2016, gaining W Hotels and Aloft. It subsequently launched Moxy (social spaces for younger travelers) and Tribute Portfolio (a soft brand for independents).
*   **Hilton** introduced Canopy (locally inspired design), Motto (micro-hotel with communal spaces), and Tempo.
*   **Hyatt** acquired Two Roads Hospitality in 2018, adding Joie de Vivre and Thompson Hotels, then expanded further with Apple Leisure Group and Dream Hotel Group.
*   **Accor** went furthest, acquiring Fairmont, Raffles, and SBE Entertainment, and investing in 25hours Hotels and Mama Shelter (Accor, 2023).

These brands emphasize design, local culture, and social spaces—the attributes that made Airbnb appealing. 

### Extended Stay and Apartment-Hotel Hybrids

Hotel companies have also moved directly into the alternative accommodation space:

*   **Marriott Homes & Villas**, launched in 2019, offers premium whole-home rentals in over 100 markets, managed by professional property management companies and integrated with the Bonvoy loyalty program. By 2024, the platform listed over 100,000 properties (Marriott International, 2024).
*   **Hilton** expanded Home2 Suites and Homewood Suites aggressively, with Home2 growing from under 200 properties in 2018 to over 600 by 2024 (Hilton, 2024).

### Technology and Experience Investments

Hotels have also invested in closing the experience and convenience gap:
*   **Mobile check-in and digital key** technology has become standard, reducing friction.
*   **Personalization engines** powered by loyalty program data enable hotels to anticipate guest preferences in ways most short-term rental hosts cannot replicate at scale.
*   **Local programming**, including curated experience guides and in-hotel cultural events, deliberately echoes the "live like a local" value proposition.

---

### 🛑 Check Your Understanding: Comp Set Expansion
**Scenario:** You are the Revenue Manager for a Residence Inn (an extended-stay hotel with in-room kitchens) in downtown Austin, Texas. Historically, your comp set included a Homewood Suites, a Courtyard, and a Hyatt Place. 
**Question:** Based on the convergence of accommodations, how should you adjust your competitive intelligence strategy?
**Analysis:** Your traditional comp set is dangerously narrow. Because your property features kitchens and caters to longer stays, your most direct competitors are likely professionally managed 1-bedroom Airbnb and Vrbo units in the immediate downtown area. You must integrate short-term rental scraping tools (like AirDNA or Lighthouse) into your pricing dashboard to monitor the rates, occupancy, and cleaning fees of these alternative units, adjusting your own length-of-stay (LOS) discounts accordingly.

## 12.4 Beyond Airbnb: The Alternative Accommodation Landscape

Airbnb dominates the narrative, but the alternative accommodation landscape is diverse—and recent financial difficulties among several prominent players offer important lessons about business model sustainability.

### Vrbo (Vacation Rentals by Owner)

Owned by Expedia Group, Vrbo focuses exclusively on whole-property vacation rentals, differentiating itself from Airbnb's broader marketplace of shared rooms and urban apartments. With approximately 2 million listings globally, it targets families and groups seeking vacation homes (Expedia Group, 2024). As part of Expedia Group, Vrbo benefits from cross-platform integration, with listings surfacing on Expedia.com and Hotels.com. Its narrower positioning has insulated it from some of the urban regulatory pressures facing Airbnb.

### Sonder: A Cautionary Tale in Asset Intensity

Founded in 2014, Sonder represented the "professionalization" of the short-term rental model. The company leased apartments, furnished them to a consistent standard, and operated them with technology-enabled service. Its value proposition—the space of an apartment with the consistency of a hotel—attracted significant investor enthusiasm.

After going public in January 2022 at an implied valuation of $2.2 billion, Sonder struggled with the capital-intensive economics of its model. Unlike Airbnb's asset-light marketplace, Sonder bore lease obligations, furnishing costs, and operational overhead. By late 2024, the company operated approximately 9,500 units (Sonder, 2024), but mounting losses led to a **Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in February 2025**.

**Exhibit 12.3: Worked Example — Asset-Light vs. Master-Lease Economics**
To understand why Sonder struggled while Airbnb thrived, consider the unit economics of a hypothetical 10-unit apartment building generating $300,000 in annual Gross Booking Value (GBV).

</table>
*The lesson is instructive:* The hybrid hotel-rental model demands significant capital investment and creates high fixed costs. The asset-light platform model (Airbnb) and the full-service hotel model each have internal coherence; the middle ground has proven financially treacherous.

### Selina: The Digital Nomad Experiment

Selina targeted digital nomads with a hybrid model combining accommodation, co-working facilities, and wellness programming across Latin America and beyond. Like Sonder, Selina's rapid expansion strained its finances, leading the company to file for bankruptcy protection in 2024 (Schaal, 2024a). This reinforces the pattern: hybrid models requiring heavy capital investment face acute financial risk when competing against asset-light platforms and well-capitalized hotel chains.

### OYO: The Budget Hotel Platform Model

OYO Hotels and Homes represents a different form of disruption: a technology-enabled platform that brands and standardizes the long tail of unbranded budget hotels. Founded in India, OYO's value proposition was simple: guarantee basic amenities (air conditioning, clean linens, free Wi-Fi) at a low price, and make those rooms bookable online (Borko, 2019). 

Transitioning to a franchise-and-management model by 2018, OYO controlled inventory, enforced brand standards, and dictated distribution terms. From a distribution perspective, OYO is significant because it brings previously invisible supply into the bookable ecosystem. However, aggressive expansion brought controversies over property quality and unsustainable cash-burn.

### The Professional Short-Term Rental Management Industry

Firms like Vacasa (the largest U.S. vacation rental manager, with approximately 44,000 homes under management) and Evolve have professionalized what was once amateur hosting (Vacasa, 2024). These companies handle pricing, guest communication, cleaning, and multi-platform distribution—listing properties simultaneously on Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com, and direct channels. The "sharing economy" in many markets is now a professionally operated, revenue-managed lodging segment.

### Booking.com's Alternative Accommodation Play

The most consequential competitive development has been Booking.com's expansion into alternative accommodations. By 2024, alternative accommodation listings on Booking.com exceeded 7.2 million—rivaling Airbnb's total (Booking Holdings, 2024). In Europe, this "everything under one roof" strategy enables travelers to compare hotels and apartments within a single search flow. For distribution professionals, this signals that the platform distinction between "hotel booking site" and "rental marketplace" is dissolving.

## 12.5 Regulatory Battles and Their Distribution Implications

The rapid growth of short-term rentals has triggered regulatory responses worldwide. The regulatory landscape is not a peripheral concern—it is a central determinant of competitive dynamics between hotels and alternative accommodations.

### Case Studies in Regulation

**New York City: The Effective Ban.** In September 2023, New York City implemented Local Law 18, requiring all short-term rental hosts to register with the city, be present during guest stays, and host no more than two guests. Active Airbnb listings fell from approximately 22,000 to fewer than 2,000 within six months (NYC Mayor's Office of Special Enforcement, 2024). CBRE (2024) reported measurable improvement in Manhattan hotel occupancy and Average Daily Rate (ADR) in the following quarters. One year later, a Skift investigation found that while hotels were thriving, the law had not yet produced a significant increase in long-term housing supply (Schaal, 2024b). Airbnb responded strategically: CEO Chesky launched hotel pilots in New York, Los Angeles, and Madrid—precisely the cities where short-term rental restrictions constrain home-sharing supply (Schaal, 2025b).

**Barcelona: Phasing Out Tourist Apartments.** In June 2024, Barcelona announced plans to eliminate all tourist apartment licenses by November 2028, affecting approximately 10,000 units (Ajuntament de Barcelona, 2024). The policy was framed explicitly as a housing affordability measure, though its survival through political transitions remains uncertain.

**Amsterdam: Night Caps and Zone Restrictions.** Amsterdam has progressively tightened short-term rental regulation, reducing the permitted annual rental period to 30 nights and banning short-term rentals entirely in three central districts (City of Amsterdam, 2023). Empirical evidence confirms that such regulatory interventions can measurably slow accommodation supply growth, though the magnitude depends on enforcement rigor (Boto-García, Baños-Pino, Del Valle, & Sustacha, 2023).

### Implications for Distribution Strategy

Regulation reshapes distribution in four concrete ways:

1.  **Supply reallocation.** In heavily regulated markets, short-term rental supply shrinks, redirecting demand toward traditional hotels and restoring hotel pricing power.
2.  **Cost structure convergence.** Registration requirements and tax collection obligations (occupancy taxes, tourism levies) add operational costs for short-term rentals, narrowing their price advantage. In Paris, hosts must collect up to €14.95 per person per night for luxury-classified properties (Mairie de Paris, 2024).
3.  **Platform accountability and lobbying costs.** Regulators increasingly hold platforms responsible for host compliance. In 2025, Airbnb acknowledged that spending on "policy initiatives" would contribute to lower profit margins, stating that "global regulations have often targeted Airbnb in response to broader societal issues like housing" (Schaal, 2025a).
4.  **Competitive recalibration.** As the regulatory playing field levels, competition shifts from price arbitrage toward value, experience, and service quality.

### The Housing Market Dimension

No discussion of short-term rental regulation is complete without acknowledging the housing affordability debate. Research has found that Airbnb's entry into U.S. zip codes is associated with measurable increases in house prices and rents, driven primarily by the conversion of long-term rental units to short-term tourist accommodation (Barron, Kung, & Proserpio, 2021). While the magnitude of these effects is debated, the finding has become a central justification for restrictive regulation.

**Scenario:** A mid-sized tourist city currently has no short-term rental regulations. During an annual 3-day music festival, hotel rates typically triple, and 2,000 new Airbnb listings temporarily pop up to absorb the excess demand. The city council just passed a law requiring all short-term rentals to undergo a 6-month commercial licensing process and pay a $5,000 annual fee.
**Question:** How will this regulation impact the market's supply elasticity and hotel pricing power during next year's music festival?
**Analysis:** The regulation destroys the market's *supply elasticity*. Casual hosts will not pay $5,000 and wait 6 months just to rent their home for a 3-day weekend. The temporary 2,000 units will not materialize. With supply now fixed (inelastic), the excess demand will compress against the limited hotel inventory, giving hotel revenue managers immense pricing power. Hotel ADRs will likely spike even higher than the historical 3x multiplier.

## 12.6 Can Hotels Compete on the Sharing Economy's Terms?

Hotels and alternative accommodations will coexist. The strategic question is how hotels can compete effectively in a landscape permanently altered by the sharing economy.

### Where Hotels Hold the Advantage

*   **Consistency and reliability.** A Hilton or Marriott delivers a predictable experience. Short-term rental quality varies enormously.
*   **Full-service amenities.** Restaurants, spas, fitness centers, and meeting spaces remain difficult for alternative accommodations to replicate.
*   **Loyalty programs.** Hotel loyalty ecosystems create switching costs that Airbnb has not replicated.
*   **Corporate and group travel.** Business travelers overwhelmingly prefer hotels for duty-of-care compliance, standardized billing, and negotiated rates.
*   **Operational depth.** Professional housekeeping, 24/7 front desk support, and on-site maintenance provide a superior service infrastructure.

### Where the Sharing Economy Holds the Advantage

*   **Space and per-person economics.** An entire apartment frequently costs less than a comparable hotel room while offering a kitchen and laundry.
*   **Unique experiences.** Treehouses and historic homes offer differentiation that branded hotels cannot replicate at scale.
*   **Supply elasticity.** During demand spikes, short-term rental supply can expand as more homeowners list properties.
*   **Pricing flexibility.** Individual hosts can adjust pricing and minimum stays with speed and granularity.

### The Convergence Ahead

The most significant trend is convergence. The boundaries between "hotel" and "alternative accommodation" are dissolving:

*   Hotels are offering apartment-style products.
*   Professional short-term rental operators are adopting hotel-quality standards.
*   OTAs display hotels and rentals side by side.
*   Loyalty programs are bridging the divide (e.g., Marriott Bonvoy members earn points on home rentals).

For distribution professionals, convergence demands three strategic adjustments. First, **competitive sets must expand** to include professionally managed rentals. Second, **channel strategy must broaden** to capture demand that begins its search on alternative accommodation filters. Third, **value propositions must sharpen**: in a market where travelers can choose from an unprecedented range of options, generic positioning is a liability.

## Industry Spotlight: Marriott Homes & Villas—A Hotel Giant Enters the Sharing Economy

When Marriott International launched Homes & Villas by Marriott Bonvoy in 2019, it signaled that the world's largest hotel company was taking the alternative accommodation threat seriously—by joining the competition rather than merely fighting it.

The model partners with established, vetted property management companies to offer premium whole-home rentals on Marriott.com, fully integrated with the Bonvoy loyalty program. By 2024, the platform listed over 100,000 properties across 100+ markets (Marriott International, 2024). 

The strategy reveals four distribution lessons:

**Leverage existing demand.** Placing home rentals within Marriott.com directs the company's massive web traffic toward a new product category without building a separate marketplace. 

**Loyalty as competitive moat.** The ability to earn and redeem Bonvoy points on home rentals creates a structural advantage. For the program's 200+ million members, choosing a Marriott home over an Airbnb listing means continuing to build toward elite status.

**Asset-light through partnerships.** Rather than managing properties directly—as Sonder attempted, at considerable cost—Marriott partners with professional managers who handle operations. 

**Seamless distribution integration.** Homes & Villas listings appear alongside traditional Marriott hotels in search results, allowing travelers to compare options within a single booking flow. 

The strategic lesson: the most effective response to disruption is often not resistance but adaptation—co-opting the new model on terms that leverage existing strengths.

## Chapter Summary

This chapter traced the sharing economy's transformation of hospitality—from Airbnb's 2008 origins to a mature, professionally operated alternative accommodation sector commanding 20–25% of the global market. We examined the measurable impact on hotel performance, the industry's strategic responses (lifestyle brands, extended-stay products, Marriott Homes & Villas), the regulatory battles reshaping supply in cities like New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam, and the convergence that is dissolving boundaries between hotels and rentals. For distribution professionals, the key takeaway is that competitive sets, channel strategies, and value propositions must all expand to reflect this permanently altered landscape. **What's Next:** Chapter 13 examines three forces accelerating the next wave of disruption—social media as a distribution channel, Asian super apps embedding travel into daily-use platforms, and generative AI transforming how travelers discover and book accommodations.

## Discussion Questions

1. **Quantitative comp set analysis.** Select one of the following cities: Barcelona, New York, or Amsterdam. Using publicly available data (AirDNA, Smith Travel Research reports, regulatory filings), estimate how many professionally managed short-term rental units compete directly with a hypothetical 200-room upscale hotel in the city center. How should the hotel's revenue manager incorporate this supply into competitive pricing decisions? What data sources and tools would they need?

2. **Strategic evaluation.** Marriott Homes & Villas and Sonder both attempted to bridge the hotel-rental divide, but with fundamentally different business models. Compare the asset-light partnership model (Marriott) with the direct-lease model (Sonder) across five dimensions: capital requirements, quality control, scalability, brand consistency, and financial risk. What does Sonder's bankruptcy suggest about the viability of each approach?

3. **Regulatory policy analysis.** Barron, Kung, and Proserpio (2021) found that Airbnb's entry into U.S. markets was associated with measurable increases in rents and house prices. Using this finding and the case studies of New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam, construct an argument for *and* against strict short-term rental regulation. Who bears the costs and who captures the benefits under each regulatory regime? Apply a stakeholder analysis framework (hoteliers, hosts, travelers, permanent residents, municipal governments).

4. **Distribution strategy under convergence.** As Booking.com now lists 7+ million alternative accommodations alongside hotels, and Marriott lists homes alongside hotel rooms, the traditional distinction between distribution channels is collapsing. Design a distribution strategy for a 150-room independent boutique hotel that must compete for visibility against both chain hotels and professional short-term rental operators. Which channels would you prioritize, what content and positioning would you emphasize, and how would you measure success?

5. **Business model sustainability.** Both Sonder and Selina filed for bankruptcy after pursuing hybrid hotel-rental models with significant capital investment. Yet Airbnb (asset-light platform) and Marriott (asset-light brand franchisor) are highly profitable. What does this pattern suggest about the relationship between asset intensity and financial sustainability in hospitality? Are there conditions under which a capital-intensive hybrid model could succeed? Support your argument with specific financial or strategic evidence.
