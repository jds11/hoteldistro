## Opening Vignette

On a Tuesday morning in March 2023, Maria Torres—director of revenue management for a 200-room boutique hotel in Barcelona's Eixample district—opened her competitive intelligence dashboard and paused. Her comp set had changed. Alongside the four branded hotels she had tracked for years, her revenue management system now displayed pricing data from 127 nearby Airbnb listings: professionally managed apartments, many offering two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a balcony for €30 less per night than her entry-level room. Three of those listings were operated by the same property management company, which had furnished them to boutique-hotel standards and maintained a 4.9-star average across 400+ reviews.

Torres's challenge was no longer simply beating the Hilton down the street on rate and occupancy. She was competing against an entirely different category of accommodation—one that did not exist a decade earlier, operated under different regulatory rules, and was listed on a platform with 7.7 million properties worldwide.

Her predicament captures the central tension of this chapter: how the sharing economy transformed hospitality distribution, who won, who adapted, and what it means for the professionals who must navigate this reshaped competitive landscape.


## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Explain how Airbnb and the sharing economy disrupted traditional hotel distribution and changed consumer expectations.
2. Analyze the hotel industry's strategic responses to sharing economy competition, including lifestyle brands, extended-stay products, and alternative accommodation offerings.
3. Compare and contrast the business models of major sharing economy and hybrid accommodation platforms (Airbnb, Vrbo, Sonder, Selina) and evaluate why some have struggled financially.
4. Evaluate the regulatory challenges facing short-term rental platforms across major global markets and their implications for distribution strategy.
5. Assess how the convergence of hotels and alternative accommodations is reshaping competitive sets, pricing strategy, and channel management.


## 11.1 The Rise of the Sharing Economy in Travel

### Defining the Sharing Economy

The sharing economy—also termed the collaborative economy or platform economy—refers to economic systems in which individuals share access to assets, resources, or services through digital platforms. In travel, this concept reshaped the short-term rental market, enabling homeowners and tenants to rent spare rooms, entire apartments, or vacation homes to travelers via online marketplaces (Zervas et al., 2017).

The concept was not entirely new. Vacation Rental by Owner (VRBO) had operated since 1995, and home-swapping services predated the internet. But the convergence of four forces in the late 2000s created conditions for explosive growth:

- **Smartphone proliferation.** Mobile devices enabled listing, discovery, and booking from anywhere, collapsing the friction of peer-to-peer transactions.
- **Trust infrastructure.** Two-sided rating systems, identity verification, and secure payment processing reduced the perceived risk of staying in a stranger's home. Research by Ert, Fleischer, and Magen (2016) demonstrated that profile photos and review scores significantly influenced booking decisions on peer-to-peer platforms.
- **Post-recession economics.** The 2008 financial crisis — the same year Airbnb was founded (GlobalData, 2024) — left homeowners seeking supplemental income and travelers seeking affordable alternatives. Between 2008 and 2012, U.S. median household income fell 8.3% in real terms (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013), creating both supply-side motivation and demand-side price sensitivity.
- **Generational preferences.** Millennial travelers expressed stronger preferences for "authentic" and "local" experiences over standardized hospitality—a pattern documented by Guttentag (2015), whose foundational study framed Airbnb as a form of disruptive innovation in the Christensen tradition.

### Airbnb's Growth Trajectory

Airbnb's arc from a 2008 experiment—three air mattresses in a San Francisco apartment rented to design conference attendees at $80 per night—to a publicly traded company valued above $80 billion constitutes one of the most dramatic growth stories in modern business. The company has evolved far beyond its peer-to-peer origins, with CEO Brian Chesky announcing in early 2026 that Airbnb is now "getting serious about hotels" — signaling a major strategic shift toward traditional hospitality distribution. Key milestones:

The financial trajectory is equally striking. Airbnb achieved net income of $4.8 billion in 2023, up from a net loss of $4.6 billion in 2020, demonstrating both the platform's operating leverage and the maturation of its business model (Airbnb, 2024a). Its take rate—the percentage of gross booking value retained as revenue—averaged approximately 14% in 2023, split between host service fees and guest service fees.

### How Airbnb Changed Distribution

From a distribution perspective, Airbnb's impact was multidimensional:

**New supply entered the market.** Millions of properties that had never been part of formal hospitality supply became bookable. This was not merely a redistribution of existing demand; it expanded the total addressable market by making inventory available in residential neighborhoods, rural areas, and unconventional property types (treehouses, yurts, houseboats) that hotels had never served.

**The definition of "accommodation" expanded.** Travelers began evaluating hotel rooms against entire apartments, villas, and unique properties—often at lower price points and with amenities like kitchens and laundry facilities. For families and groups, the per-person economics of a three-bedroom apartment frequently undercut even midscale hotels.

**Consumer expectations shifted.** Airbnb popularized the notion that travel accommodation should feel personal, local, and experiential. As Chesky articulated in 2014: "We do not want people to travel like tourists. We want them to travel like they live there" (Gallagher, 2017, p. 112). Whether or not travelers genuinely seek "authenticity" in any rigorous sense, the framing reshaped marketing language across the industry.

**A new distribution channel emerged for professional operators.** As Airbnb matured, professional property managers and small hospitality companies began listing alongside individual hosts, fundamentally changing the platform's character. Dogru, Mody, Suess, Line, and Bonn (2020) posed the question in *Tourism Management*: is Airbnb still a sharing economy platform, or has it become a lodging corporation? Their analysis found that multi-unit, professionally managed listings increasingly compete directly with hotels. Dogru, Mody, Line, and Hanks (2022), writing in the *Cornell Hospitality Quarterly*, demonstrated that multi-unit host listings have a measurably greater negative impact on hotel revenues than single-unit (true peer-to-peer) listings—suggesting that the "sharing" economy is, in many markets, a commercial lodging operation distributed through a tech platform.

### Airbnb's Own Distribution Strategy

For a distribution textbook, it is worth examining how Airbnb itself acquires supply and demand—a topic often overlooked in analyses that focus solely on its impact on hotels.

On the **demand side**, Airbnb has built one of the most powerful organic search presences in travel. Its SEO strategy—generating millions of indexed pages for city, neighborhood, and property-type combinations—drives substantial unpaid traffic. The company spent $1.8 billion on sales and marketing in 2023, but notably shifted from performance marketing (paid search, metasearch) toward brand campaigns, arguing that brand marketing delivers higher long-term returns (Airbnb, 2024a). The 2021 "Made Possible by Hosts" campaign, launched as travel rebounded from COVID-19, was credited with reducing customer acquisition costs while driving record direct traffic. Skift Research analysis of Airbnb's S-1 filing revealed that only 23 percent of the platform's traffic came from paid search in 2019—a pittance compared to Booking Holdings or Expedia Group, both of which spent billions on Google advertising (Borko & Geerts, 2020). Further aiding this organic strength, 69 percent of Airbnb's revenue comes from repeat customers, indicating strong brand loyalty without a formal loyalty program.

On the **supply side**, Airbnb invests in host recruitment and retention through tools like smart pricing algorithms, professional photography services, AirCover insurance, and Superhost recognition programs. The platform's ability to attract and retain hosts is its most critical competitive advantage—without differentiated supply, it becomes merely another OTA. Skift Research estimated that approximately 90 percent of Airbnb's listings are from individual or "mom and pop" micro-entrepreneurs who may have multiple listings but remain distinctly separate from the emerging landscape of professional property managers (Borko & Geerts, 2020). These hosts are largely "all-in" on Airbnb and rarely list on competing platforms—giving Airbnb a supply moat that is difficult to replicate. Airbnb estimated 317 million room nights sold in 2019 at an average daily rate of $118, yielding gross bookings of $37.4 billion, with accommodations comprising 97–99 percent of company totals (Borko & Geerts, 2020). The platform's effective occupancy rate for active listings was approximately 19 percent—structurally lower than the hotel industry's 30+ percent, reflecting the seasonal, part-time nature of much sharing-economy supply.

### Airbnb's Strategic Pivot: "Hotels, Hotels, Hotels"

In a dramatic shift that highlights the convergence of sharing economy and traditional hospitality, Airbnb has made a major strategic pivot toward hotel distribution. In January 2026, the company elevated Jesse Stein to a newly created **"head of hotels"** role and hired Lou Zameryka from Booking.com, where he had spent nearly two decades, as **"global head, hotel enterprise and connectivity partnerships."** The company also added Jim Alderman, former CEO of Radisson Americas, to its business development team—signaling an unprecedented focus on traditional hospitality partnerships.

This strategic shift reflects both regulatory pressure and market maturation. As CEO Brian Chesky stated: "We are now getting serious about hotels" (Schaal, 2025). The move represents Airbnb's answer to regulatory crackdowns that have shut out short-term rentals in cities like New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam. When home-sharing becomes legally constrained, hotels offer an alternative inventory source to maintain growth.

Key strategic questions remain unanswered: Will hotel listings be separate from or integrated with home stays? Will Airbnb focus on boutique properties only, or expand to major chains? How will traditional hoteliers respond to Airbnb's direct competition with OTAs like Booking.com and Expedia? The answers will significantly impact distribution dynamics across the hospitality industry.


## 11.2 The Impact on Traditional Hotels

### Measuring the Disruption

Academic research has confirmed what hoteliers long suspected: Airbnb's market entry produces measurable effects on hotel performance. Zervas, Proserpio, and Byers (2017), in a widely cited study in the *Journal of Marketing Research*, found that a 1% increase in Airbnb listings in Texas led to a 0.05% decrease in hotel revenue, with the greatest impact on lower-priced hotels not catering to business travelers. Subsequent research has replicated and extended these findings. Farronato and Fradkin (2022), publishing in the *American Economic Review*, found that Airbnb's competitive effect on hotels is strongest in markets with inelastic hotel supply and during peak-demand periods when capacity constraints would otherwise drive hotel rates higher. Destefanis, Neirotti, and Paolucci (2022) examined independent hotels specifically and found that smaller, independently operated properties were disproportionately affected, lacking the brand recognition and loyalty programs that buffer chain-affiliated competitors.

The picture is nuanced across three dimensions:

**Segment matters.** Luxury and upper-upscale hotels have been less affected than economy and midscale properties. Business hotels with strong corporate contracts remain relatively insulated, while leisure-oriented properties in tourist destinations face the greatest competitive pressure (Dogru, Mody, & Suess, 2020). This segmentation aligns with the broader OTA market composition: leisure travelers account for 79% of global OTA market value versus just 17% for business travelers (GlobalData, 2024), meaning alternative accommodations compete most directly in the leisure-dominant segment where OTAs are strongest.

**Market conditions matter.** During periods of high demand, Airbnb functions primarily as overflow capacity rather than a direct hotel substitute. During low-demand periods, when travelers are most price-sensitive, the competitive impact intensifies (Zervas et al., 2017). Farronato and Fradkin (2022) found that Airbnb's "capacity-smoothing" effect benefits consumers most in supply-constrained markets during demand spikes.

**Geography matters.** In cities with constrained hotel supply and high average daily rates—New York, San Francisco, London, Paris—Airbnb's impact has been most pronounced. In markets with abundant, affordable hotel inventory, the substitution effect is smaller.

### Market Share and Maturation

By 2024, short-term rentals (encompassing Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com apartment listings, and other platforms) accounted for an estimated 20–25% of the global accommodation market by revenue, up from approximately 10% in 2015 (Phocuswright, 2024). In the United States, short-term rental revenue reached approximately $64 billion in 2023 (AirDNA, 2024). Skift Research's analysis provides additional precision: STRs represent 14.2 percent of the $908 billion global accommodation market, with the U.S. market alone at $67 billion (18.6 percent of domestic accommodations)—a share that was on track to reach 14 percent globally by 2026 but instead broke that threshold in 2021, five years ahead of schedule, as the pandemic accelerated adoption (Borko, 2023). The sector is generating an estimated $19 billion annually above where pre-pandemic trend lines would have placed it.

Importantly, the growth trajectory is moderating. After explosive expansion, Airbnb's year-over-year revenue growth decelerated from 77% in 2022 to 18% in 2023 (Airbnb, 2024a), suggesting market maturation. Supply growth has also slowed in many urban markets as regulatory constraints take effect—a dynamic explored in Section 11.5.


## 11.3 The Hotel Industry Fights Back

The hotel industry's response to sharing economy competition has been more aggressive and strategic than early skeptics predicted. Major chains have adapted their distribution strategies to compete on — and in some cases co-opt — the sharing economy's own terms.

### Lifestyle and Boutique Brands

Recognizing that sharing economy travelers were drawn to uniqueness, personality, and local character, major hotel companies launched or acquired lifestyle brands designed to feel less corporate and more experiential:

- **Marriott** acquired Starwood in 2016, gaining W Hotels, Aloft, and the Luxury Collection. It subsequently launched Moxy (social spaces and lower price points for younger travelers) and Tribute Portfolio (a soft brand for independents).
- **Hilton** introduced Canopy (locally inspired design), Motto (micro-hotel with communal spaces), and Tempo (lifestyle focused on well-being).
- **Hyatt** acquired Two Roads Hospitality in 2018, adding Joie de Vivre, Thompson Hotels, and Alila, then expanded further with Apple Leisure Group and Dream Hotel Group.
- **Accor** went furthest, acquiring Fairmont, Raffles, and SBE Entertainment (SLS, Delano), and investing in 25hours Hotels and Mama Shelter (Accor, 2023).

The common thread: these brands emphasize design, local culture, food and beverage programming, and social spaces—the attributes that made Airbnb appealing to experience-seeking travelers. Whether this strategy has measurably recaptured demand from short-term rentals remains an open research question, but the scale of investment signals the industry's conviction.

### Extended Stay and Apartment-Hotel Hybrids

Hotel companies have also moved directly into the alternative accommodation space:

- **Marriott Homes & Villas**, launched in 2019, offers premium whole-home rentals in over 100 markets, managed by professional property management companies and integrated with the Bonvoy loyalty program. By 2024, the platform listed over 100,000 properties (Marriott International, 2024).
- **Hyatt** partnered with Oasis Collections and invested in vacation rental companies to offer home-style accommodations to World of Hyatt members.
- **Accor** invested in onefinestay (luxury home rentals) and Squarebreak (French vacation rentals).

Extended-stay brands have experienced a parallel renaissance as the boundaries between hotel stays and apartment living blur:

- **Hilton** expanded Home2 Suites and Homewood Suites aggressively, with Home2 growing from under 200 properties in 2018 to over 600 by 2024 (Hilton, 2024).
- **Marriott** grew Residence Inn and Element portfolios.
- **Extended Stay America** has undergone ownership changes and expansion, reflecting investor confidence in the segment's long-term demand profile.

### Technology and Experience Investments

Hotels have also invested in closing the experience and convenience gap that initially gave platforms like Airbnb an edge:

- **Mobile check-in and digital key** technology has become standard at major brands, reducing friction and creating a seamless arrival experience.
- **Personalization engines** powered by loyalty program data enable hotels to anticipate guest preferences—from room temperature to minibar contents—in ways most short-term rental hosts cannot replicate at scale.
- **Local programming**, including partnerships with neighborhood restaurants, curated experience guides, and in-hotel cultural events, has become a strategic differentiator, deliberately echoing the "live like a local" value proposition that Airbnb pioneered.


## 11.4 Beyond Airbnb: The Alternative Accommodation Landscape

Airbnb dominates the narrative, but the alternative accommodation landscape is diverse—and recent financial difficulties among several prominent players offer important lessons about business model sustainability.

### Vrbo (Vacation Rentals by Owner)

Owned by Expedia Group, Vrbo focuses exclusively on whole-property vacation rentals, differentiating itself from Airbnb's broader marketplace of shared rooms, private rooms, and entire homes:

- **Target market.** Families and groups seeking vacation homes, beach houses, and cabins—a demographic that values space, privacy, and predictability.
- **Supply.** Approximately 2 million listings globally, concentrated in traditional vacation destinations (Expedia Group, 2024).
- **Distribution advantage.** As part of Expedia Group, Vrbo benefits from cross-platform integration, with listings surfacing on Expedia.com and Hotels.com in some markets.

Vrbo's narrower positioning—no shared spaces, no urban apartments—has insulated it from some of the regulatory pressures facing Airbnb in major cities while limiting its addressable market.

### Sonder: A Cautionary Tale

Founded in 2014, Sonder represented the "professionalization" of the short-term rental model. The company leased apartments and boutique hotel properties, designed and furnished them to a consistent standard, and operated them with technology-enabled service. Its value proposition—the space and privacy of an apartment with the consistency of a hotel—attracted significant investor enthusiasm.

After going public via SPAC in January 2022 at an implied valuation of $2.2 billion, Sonder struggled with the capital-intensive economics of its model. Unlike Airbnb's asset-light marketplace, Sonder bore lease obligations, furnishing costs, and operational overhead for each unit. By late 2024, the company operated approximately 9,500 units across 40+ markets (Sonder, 2024), but mounting losses led to a **Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in February 2025**.

The lesson is instructive: the hybrid hotel-rental model—offering hotel consistency through an apartment format—demands significant capital investment while competing on price against both lower-cost Airbnb hosts and established hotel brands with superior distribution infrastructure and loyalty ecosystems. The asset-light platform model and the full-service hotel model each have internal coherence; the middle ground has proven financially treacherous.

### Selina: The Digital Nomad Experiment

Selina targeted digital nomads and remote workers with a hybrid model combining accommodation (dorms to private suites), co-working facilities, restaurants, and wellness programming. The company converted existing properties in emerging destinations across Latin America and beyond, distributing through its own platform, OTAs, and Airbnb, while offering monthly co-living packages.

Like Sonder, Selina's rapid expansion strained its finances. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2024 (Schaal, 2024a), reinforcing the pattern: hybrid models that require heavy capital investment to deliver a differentiated physical product face acute financial risk, particularly when competing against asset-light platforms on the one hand and well-capitalized hotel chains on the other.

### OYO: The Budget Hotel Platform Model

While Airbnb and Vrbo disrupt from the sharing-economy side, OYO Hotels and Homes represents a different form of disruption: a technology-enabled platform that brands and standardizes the long tail of unbranded budget hotels. Founded in 2013 by then-19-year-old Ritesh Agarwal in India, OYO identified a pain point familiar to any budget traveler in emerging markets—hundreds of unbranded mom-and-pop hotels in any given city, with wildly varying standards of hygiene, service, and online booking capability. OYO's value proposition was simple: guarantee basic amenities (air conditioning, clean linens, sanitary washrooms, free Wi-Fi) at a low price, and make those rooms bookable online (Borko, 2019).

OYO's business model evolved rapidly. After struggling with an initial aggregator model where it purchased wholesale blocks of rooms from hotels, OYO transitioned to a franchise-and-management model (its "2.0" approach) by 2018, where it controlled 100 percent of a property's inventory, enforced brand standards through regular audits, and dictated distribution terms—a structure immediately recognizable to anyone familiar with traditional hotel franchise agreements (Borko, 2019). By 2019, OYO claimed over one million rooms across 80+ countries, a scale achieved in roughly six years—an unprecedented pace in hospitality history. Backed by SoftBank's Vision Fund with a valuation of approximately $10 billion, OYO was simultaneously a hotel company, a technology platform (with a proprietary PMS), and a distribution channel with a strong first-party booking site.

From a distribution perspective, OYO's model is significant because it brings previously invisible supply—budget hotels that lacked the technology or brand awareness to participate in online distribution—into the bookable ecosystem. For distribution professionals, OYO represents the proposition that technology and standardization can create branded value in the most fragmented segment of global hospitality. However, OYO's aggressive expansion also brought controversies over property quality, franchisee disputes, and unsustainable cash-burn—cautionary lessons about the limits of growth-at-all-costs strategies in asset-light hospitality.

### The Professional STR Management Industry

A less visible but strategically significant development has been the rise of professional short-term rental management companies. Firms like Vacasa (the largest U.S. vacation rental manager, with approximately 44,000 homes under management as of 2024) and Evolve (a technology-enabled management platform) have professionalized what was once amateur hosting (Vacasa, 2024).

These companies handle pricing (using dynamic pricing tools like PriceLabs, Beyond, and Wheelhouse), guest communication, cleaning, maintenance, and multi-platform distribution—listing properties simultaneously on Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com, and their own direct channels. Their emergence has transformed the competitive dynamics: the "sharing economy" in many markets is now a professionally operated, revenue-managed lodging segment that competes with hotels not on charm and authenticity, but on price, space, and amenities.

### Booking.com's Alternative Accommodation Play

The most consequential competitive development has been Booking.com's expansion into alternative accommodations. By 2024, alternative accommodation listings on Booking.com exceeded 7.2 million—rivaling Airbnb's total—making it the world's largest single platform for both hotels *and* alternative accommodations (Booking Holdings, 2024). In Europe, where Booking.com's brand recognition and user base are strongest, this "everything under one roof" strategy has proven particularly powerful, enabling travelers to compare hotels and apartments within a single search and booking flow.

For distribution professionals, Booking.com's hybrid approach signals that the platform distinction between "hotel booking site" and "rental marketplace" is dissolving. Channel strategy must account for this convergence.


## 11.5 Regulatory Battles and Their Distribution Implications

The rapid growth of short-term rentals has triggered regulatory responses worldwide, creating a patchwork of rules with direct implications for distribution and supply dynamics. The regulatory landscape is not a peripheral concern—it is a central determinant of competitive dynamics between hotels and alternative accommodations.

### Case Studies in Regulation

**New York City: The Effective Ban.** In September 2023, New York City implemented Local Law 18, requiring all short-term rental hosts to register with the city, be present during guest stays, and host no more than two guests. Enforcement was immediate and dramatic: active Airbnb listings fell from approximately 22,000 to fewer than 2,000 within six months—a 90 percent reduction that effectively constituted a ban (NYC Mayor's Office of Special Enforcement, 2024). Hotel industry metrics responded accordingly—CBRE (2024) reported measurable improvement in Manhattan hotel occupancy and ADR in the quarters following implementation, though isolating the regulatory effect from broader demand trends requires caution.

One year after enforcement began, a detailed Skift investigation found mixed results: hotels were thriving, but the law had not yet produced a significant increase in long-term housing supply—the policy's stated goal. Small-scale hosts who had relied on Airbnb income to cover mortgages or supplement retirement savings were disproportionately affected, while professional operators with legal counsel found workarounds (Schaal, 2024b). Airbnb's response was strategic: CEO Chesky launched hotel pilots in New York, Los Angeles, and Madrid—precisely the cities where short-term rental restrictions constrain home-sharing supply (Schaal, 2025).

**Barcelona: Phasing Out Tourist Apartments.** In June 2024, Barcelona's city government announced plans to eliminate all tourist apartment licenses by November 2028, affecting approximately 10,000 licensed short-term rental units (Ajuntament de Barcelona, 2024). The policy was framed explicitly as a housing affordability measure—Barcelona's median rent had risen substantially between 2014 and 2023, and city officials attributed a meaningful share of that increase to the conversion of residential units to tourist accommodation (Ajuntament de Barcelona, 2024). Implementation remains contested by property owners and platform operators, and the policy's survival through political transitions is uncertain.

**Amsterdam: Night Caps and Zone Restrictions.** Amsterdam has progressively tightened short-term rental regulation, reducing the permitted annual rental period from 60 to 30 nights in 2019 and banning short-term rentals entirely in three central districts in 2023 (City of Amsterdam, 2023). The city's approach illustrates a middle path: permitting home-sharing in moderation while constraining commercialization and protecting residential housing stock.

**National Frameworks.** Japan enacted the Minpaku Law in 2018, creating a national registration system with a 180-day annual cap. France has progressively tightened rules, with a 2024 law reducing tax advantages for furnished tourist rentals and empowering mayors to set lower night-caps (Reuters, 2024). In both cases, national legislation sought to create consistency where fragmented municipal approaches had created confusion for platforms, hosts, and travelers.

**Permissive Jurisdictions.** Many U.S. markets outside major cities have adopted lighter-touch approaches focused on safety standards and tax collection without strict night-cap limits—though this may reflect lower political pressure rather than deliberate policy philosophy.

### Implications for Distribution Strategy

Regulation reshapes distribution in four concrete ways:

**Supply reallocation.** In heavily regulated markets, short-term rental supply shrinks, redirecting demand toward traditional hotels. New York's experience demonstrates this effect clearly: when 90% of Airbnb listings disappear, hotels recapture pricing power.

**Cost structure convergence.** Registration requirements, tax collection obligations (occupancy taxes, tourism levies), and safety standard compliance add operational costs for short-term rental operators, narrowing their price advantage over hotels. In Paris, where hosts must collect and remit a tourist tax of up to €14.95 per person per night for luxury-classified properties (Mairie de Paris, 2024), the cost differential between hotels and rentals has compressed.

**Platform accountability and lobbying costs.** Regulators increasingly hold platforms responsible for host compliance, requiring data-sharing with authorities and removal of non-compliant listings. This transforms platforms from neutral marketplaces into regulated distribution channels with compliance obligations. The financial burden is growing: in 2025, Airbnb acknowledged for the first time that spending on "policy initiatives" would contribute to lower profit margins, alongside investments in new business lines. The company stated that "global regulations have often targeted Airbnb in response to broader societal issues like housing" and pledged to challenge "unfair laws" while working with policymakers (Schaal, 2025a). The cost of regulatory engagement—lobbying, legal challenges, compliance infrastructure—is becoming a material line item for platforms operating in heavily regulated markets.

**Competitive recalibration.** As the regulatory playing field levels, competition between hotels and short-term rentals shifts from price arbitrage toward value, experience, and service quality—dimensions where hotels possess structural advantages in consistency, amenities, and operational infrastructure.

### The Housing Market Dimension

No discussion of short-term rental regulation is complete without acknowledging the housing affordability debate. Research by Barron, Kung, and Proserpio (2021), published in the *Journal of Financial Economics*, found that Airbnb's entry into U.S. zip codes was associated with a 0.27% increase in house prices and a 0.49% increase in rents, driven primarily by the conversion of long-term rental units to short-term tourist accommodation. While the magnitude of these effects is debated—and varies significantly by market—the finding has become a central justification for restrictive regulation. Hospitality students should understand this dynamic not only because it shapes the competitive environment but because it raises ethical questions about the industry's relationship with local communities (see Discussion Question 3).


## 11.6 Can Hotels Compete on the Sharing Economy's Terms?

Hotels and alternative accommodations will coexist. The strategic question is how hotels can compete effectively in a landscape permanently altered by the sharing economy—and where each model holds structural advantages.

### Where Hotels Hold the Advantage

- **Consistency and reliability.** A Hilton or Marriott delivers a predictable experience across thousands of properties. Short-term rental quality varies enormously—a problem that even professional management companies have not fully solved.
- **Full-service amenities.** Restaurants, spas, fitness centers, concierge services, meeting spaces, and pools remain difficult for most alternative accommodations to replicate.
- **Loyalty programs.** Hotel loyalty ecosystems—with status tiers, upgrades, free nights, and cross-brand portability—create switching costs that Airbnb has not replicated despite periodic experimentation with loyalty features.
- **Corporate and group travel.** Business travelers, meeting planners, and corporate travel departments overwhelmingly prefer hotels for duty-of-care compliance, standardized billing, negotiated rates, and meeting infrastructure.
- **Operational depth.** Professional housekeeping, 24/7 front desk support, on-site maintenance, and ADA-compliant facilities provide a service infrastructure that most short-term rental operations cannot match.

### Where the Sharing Economy Holds the Advantage

- **Space and per-person economics.** An entire apartment frequently costs less than a comparable hotel room while offering a kitchen, living area, and laundry—advantages that are decisive for families and extended stays.
- **Unique and neighborhood-embedded experiences.** Treehouses, historic homes, and residential-neighborhood properties offer differentiation that branded hotels cannot replicate at scale.
- **Supply elasticity.** During demand spikes, short-term rental supply can expand as more homeowners list properties, while hotel supply is fixed in the short term. Farronato and Fradkin (2022) demonstrated that this elasticity moderates hotel pricing power during peak periods.
- **Pricing flexibility.** Individual hosts and professional managers can adjust pricing, minimum stays, and policies with speed and granularity that large hotel operations often cannot match.

### The Convergence Ahead

The most significant trend is convergence. The boundaries between "hotel" and "alternative accommodation" are dissolving across multiple dimensions:

- Hotels are offering apartment-style products (Marriott Homes & Villas, Accor Apartments & Villas).
- Professional short-term rental operators are adopting hotel-quality standards, branded amenities, and sophisticated revenue management tools.
- OTAs and metasearch engines display hotels and rentals side by side, enabling consumers to choose based on needs rather than accommodation category.
- Loyalty programs are bridging the divide: Marriott Bonvoy members earn points on home rentals; Booking.com's Genius program applies to all listing types.

For distribution professionals, convergence demands three strategic adjustments. First, **competitive sets must expand**: revenue managers who exclude Airbnb and professionally managed rentals from their comp sets will make pricing decisions with incomplete market intelligence. Second, **channel strategy must broaden**: hotels that rely solely on traditional OTAs and brand.com miss the growing share of demand that begins its search on Airbnb or Booking.com's alternative accommodation filters. Third, **value propositions must sharpen**: in a market where travelers can choose from an unprecedented range of options, generic positioning is a liability. The properties that thrive—whether hotels or rentals—will be those that articulate a clear, defensible reason to book.


## Industry Spotlight: Marriott Homes & Villas—A Hotel Giant Enters the Sharing Economy

When Marriott International launched Homes & Villas by Marriott Bonvoy in 2019, it signaled that the world's largest hotel company was taking the alternative accommodation threat seriously—by joining the competition rather than merely fighting it.

The model partners with established, vetted property management companies to offer premium whole-home rentals on Marriott.com, fully integrated with the Bonvoy loyalty program. By 2024, the platform listed over 100,000 properties across 100+ markets (Marriott International, 2024). The average property is a high-end home or villa positioned in the premium leisure segment—Airbnb's fastest-growing and most profitable category.

The strategy reveals four distribution lessons:

**Leverage existing demand.** Placing home rentals within Marriott.com directs the company's massive web traffic (over 100 million monthly visitors) toward a new product category without building a separate marketplace. The incremental cost of adding a distribution channel to an existing platform is far lower than creating one from scratch.

**Loyalty as competitive moat.** The ability to earn and redeem Bonvoy points on home rentals creates a structural advantage that standalone rental platforms cannot replicate. For the program's 200+ million members, choosing a Marriott home over an Airbnb listing means continuing to build toward elite status and free night awards—a switching cost that compounds over time.

**Asset-light through partnerships.** Rather than managing properties directly—as Sonder attempted, at considerable cost—Marriott partners with professional managers who handle operations. This mirrors Airbnb's own asset-light model while maintaining brand standards.

**Seamless distribution integration.** Homes & Villas listings appear alongside traditional Marriott hotels in search results, allowing travelers to compare options within a single booking flow. This integration is a powerful distribution advantage: the guest never needs to leave the Marriott ecosystem to access alternative accommodations.

The strategic lesson: the most effective response to disruption is often not resistance but adaptation—co-opting the new model on terms that leverage existing strengths.


## Chapter Summary

This chapter traced the sharing economy's transformation of hospitality—from Airbnb's 2008 origins to a mature, professionally operated alternative accommodation sector commanding 20–25% of the global market. We examined the measurable impact on hotel performance, the industry's strategic responses (lifestyle brands, extended-stay products, Marriott Homes & Villas), the regulatory battles reshaping supply in cities like New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam, and the convergence that is dissolving boundaries between hotels and rentals. For distribution professionals, the key takeaway is that competitive sets, channel strategies, and value propositions must all expand to reflect this permanently altered landscape. **What's Next:** Chapter 12 examines three forces accelerating the next wave of disruption—social media as a distribution channel, Asian super apps embedding travel into daily-use platforms, and generative AI transforming how travelers discover and book accommodations.

## Discussion Questions

1. **Quantitative comp set analysis.** Select one of the following cities: Barcelona, New York, or Amsterdam. Using publicly available data (AirDNA, STR reports, regulatory filings), estimate how many professionally managed short-term rental units compete directly with a hypothetical 200-room upscale hotel in the city center. How should the hotel's revenue manager incorporate this supply into competitive pricing decisions? What data sources and tools would they need?

2. **Strategic evaluation.** Marriott Homes & Villas and Sonder both attempted to bridge the hotel-rental divide, but with fundamentally different business models. Compare the asset-light partnership model (Marriott) with the direct-lease model (Sonder) across five dimensions: capital requirements, quality control, scalability, brand consistency, and financial risk. What does Sonder's bankruptcy suggest about the viability of each approach?

3. **Regulatory policy analysis.** Barron, Kung, and Proserpio (2021) found that Airbnb's entry into U.S. markets was associated with measurable increases in rents and house prices. Using this finding and the case studies of New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam, construct an argument for *and* against strict short-term rental regulation. Who bears the costs and who captures the benefits under each regulatory regime? Apply a stakeholder analysis framework (hoteliers, hosts, travelers, permanent residents, municipal governments).

4. **Distribution strategy under convergence.** As Booking.com now lists 7+ million alternative accommodations alongside hotels, and Marriott lists homes alongside hotel rooms, the traditional distinction between distribution channels is collapsing. Design a distribution strategy for a 150-room independent boutique hotel that must compete for visibility against both chain hotels and professional STR operators. Which channels would you prioritize, what content and positioning would you emphasize, and how would you measure success?

5. **Business model sustainability.** Both Sonder and Selina filed for bankruptcy after pursuing hybrid hotel-rental models with significant capital investment. Yet Airbnb (asset-light platform) and Marriott (asset-light brand franchisor) are highly profitable. What does this pattern suggest about the relationship between asset intensity and financial sustainability in hospitality? Are there conditions under which a capital-intensive hybrid model could succeed? Support your argument with specific financial or strategic evidence.
