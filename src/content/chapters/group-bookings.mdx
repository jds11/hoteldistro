## Opening Vignette: Priya's March Dilemma

Priya Chandrasekaran had been director of revenue strategy at the Grand Cypress Orlando — a 1,200-room convention hotel — for exactly eleven months when the decision landed on her desk. It was the second week of January 2023, and her forecasts told an uncomfortable story: March was shaping up soft. Transient demand projections showed occupancy barely cracking 60 percent during the third week of the month — a valley period that, left unfilled, would put her Q1 Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) target out of reach. Ownership had made that target a condition of the management company's incentive fee. Priya's boss had made it a condition of her continued employment, though he'd said it with a smile.

Then the Request for Proposal (RFP) arrived. The American Society of Association Executives (ASAE) had issued a request for proposals for a 3,000-attendee regional leadership conference — peak nights falling precisely in that soft third week of March. The room block: 1,800 nights over four days. The requested rate: $179, roughly 12 percent below the hotel's projected transient best available rate of $204.

On paper, it looked like a gift. But Priya had been in revenue management long enough to know that "on paper" was where bad decisions hid. She assembled a cross-functional team the next morning. Her revenue analyst pulled transient demand forecasts by day and segment. The catering director projected $1.2 million in food-and-beverage (F&B) revenue from the conference's planned banquets, breakout lunches, and reception. The convention services manager mapped meeting-room configurations against two smaller groups already on the books for overlapping dates. The director of sales, who had a fifteen-year relationship with the ASAE planner, provided intel on historical pickup patterns — ASAE groups, he noted, consistently washed about 15 percent, meaning they'd likely pick up around 1,530 of the 1,800 blocked rooms.

Seventy-two hours later, Priya's team submitted a proposal through Cvent's Supplier Network, accompanied by a separately hosted virtual tour showcasing the property's renovated ballroom and breakout spaces. The displacement analysis told the story: even at a discounted room rate, the total revenue contribution — rooms, F&B, audiovisual, parking, resort fees — exceeded what transient demand alone would generate by more than $400,000 over the four-day period.

Six weeks later, the contract was signed. The group filled the hotel's need period, anchored over a million dollars in ancillary spending, and introduced the property to thousands of association professionals — future planners, future guests, future advocates. Priya hit her Q1 target with room to spare.

Her decision was not magic. It was methodology — the same analytical framework this chapter will teach you.

## 5.1 The Group Segment: An Overview

Group business has long been a cornerstone of hotel revenue, particularly for full-service and convention properties. Skift Research estimated that group bookings accounted for approximately 14 percent of global hotel gross bookings in 2024 (Skift Research, 2024). Notably, offline group bookings grew their share from 7% of total distribution in 2019 to 12% in 2024 — one of the most significant post-COVID channel shifts in the industry (Agarwal, 2024). 

The HEDNA/NYU Tisch/RateGain *State of Distribution 2025* study reinforces the segment's centrality: Groups-Corporate (24% of revenue) and Groups-SMERF (25%) together account for nearly half of total hotel revenue across the 21,000+ properties surveyed (HEDNA et al., 2025). For large convention hotels, that share can be substantially higher — at major convention properties, group room revenue frequently exceeds 40 percent of total room revenue, according to industry practitioners and property-level CoStar benchmarking data.

### Defining "Group"

In hotel parlance, a "group" is typically defined as a block of rooms — often ten or more — booked under a single contract at a negotiated rate. But the group segment is far from monolithic. It encompasses a wide array of demand generators, each with distinct booking behaviors, lead times, rate sensitivities, and ancillary revenue profiles.

### Major Group Subsegments

**Corporate Meetings and Conferences.** These include board meetings, management retreats, product launches, sales kickoffs, and training programs. Corporate groups tend to be smaller (10–200 attendees), have shorter lead times (30–120 days), and are less price-sensitive than association business. They often generate significant ancillary revenue through AV rentals, catering, and executive amenities. 

The scale of this subsegment is massive. According to the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA), U.S. business travel spending reached $356 billion in 2024, with meetings and events representing a substantial share (GBTA, 2024). GlobalData's analysis confirms the segment's recovery trajectory: demand has rebounded sharply, with 195.71 million outbound business travelers globally in 2024 (up 17.95% year-over-year) and 992.82 million domestic business travelers (up 5.57% YoY), led by the U.S. and China (GlobalData, 2025). 

Several key structural trends are currently reshaping corporate group business (GlobalData, 2025):
*   **Bleisure Travel:** Younger employees increasingly extend business trips for leisure, creating shoulder-night transient demand around group blocks.
*   **Corporate Sustainability:** Stricter corporate mandates require hotels to provide carbon-footprint reporting for meetings and adhere to green operational standards to even qualify for RFPs.
*   **The Sharing Economy:** Alternative accommodations are increasingly utilized for off-site retreats and extended corporate stays.

**Conventions and Association Meetings.** Associations — professional, trade, and civic organizations — drive some of the largest group events in the industry. The International Association of Exhibitions and Events (IAEE) reported that the U.S. exhibitions industry alone generated $101 billion in direct spending in 2023 (IAEE, 2024). Conventions feature long lead times (one to five years for citywide events), complex RFP processes, and significant destination-level economic impact. They typically require large room blocks, extensive meeting space, and coordination with convention and visitors bureaus (CVBs).

**Weddings and Social Events.** The wedding segment represents a distinct and emotionally driven subsegment. The Knot's 2023 Real Weddings Study found that the average U.S. wedding cost $35,000, with venue costs representing the single largest line item (The Knot, 2024). Wedding blocks are typically 20–150 rooms over one to three nights, with high F&B and event-space revenue.

**Sports Groups.** Youth and collegiate sports tournaments, professional team travel, and major sporting events generate predictable, recurring group demand. Sports groups tend to be highly rate-sensitive but book reliably and fill rooms during weekends and shoulder periods. The Sports Events & Tourism Association (Sports ETA) estimated that sports tourism generated $45.1 billion in traveler spending in 2023 (Sports ETA, 2024).

**SMERF.** This acronym — Social, Military, Educational, Religious, and Fraternal — captures a category of groups that are typically more budget-conscious, book further in advance, and are more flexible on dates than corporate groups. SMERF business is particularly valuable for filling need periods and weekends at urban hotels. While average daily rates (ADRs) tend to be lower, SMERF groups often have low cancellation rates and generate meaningful F&B revenue.

## 5.2 How Group Distribution Works

Unlike transient distribution, which relies on real-time electronic channels and individual booking decisions, group distribution is fundamentally a relationship-driven, negotiation-based process. It involves multiple stakeholders, longer sales cycles, and a distinct set of distribution intermediaries and technologies.

### The Request for Proposal (RFP)

The RFP is the lingua franca of group distribution. A meeting planner or event organizer issues an RFP specifying dates, room-block requirements, meeting-space needs, F&B expectations, AV requirements, and budget parameters. The RFP may be distributed to multiple hotels simultaneously — often through digital platforms — creating a competitive bidding dynamic.

The evolution of the RFP process has been dramatic. What was once a labor-intensive exchange of paper documents, phone calls, and faxes has migrated substantially to digital platforms. Cvent, the dominant player in this space, processes millions of RFPs annually, connecting planners with hotels worldwide (Cvent, 2024). Other platforms — including HotelPlanner, Groups360, and Tripleseat — have also gained traction, particularly in specific subsegments.

### Convention and Visitors Bureaus (CVBs)

CVBs — increasingly rebranded as destination marketing organizations (DMOs) — play a critical intermediary role in group distribution, particularly for large conventions and citywide events. CVBs market their destination to meeting planners, help source appropriate venues, coordinate multi-hotel room blocks, and provide destination services such as airport transfers and local programming.

For hotels, CVBs are a significant lead-generation channel. Destinations International reported that U.S. CVBs influenced more than $100 billion in direct visitor spending annually (Destinations International, 2023). The relationship between a hotel and its local CVB is often a key determinant of the property's success in attracting large-scale group business. CVBs typically do not charge hotels a commission on group bookings; instead, they are funded through hotel occupancy taxes and membership dues.

### Citywide Conventions and Multi-Hotel Blocks

Among the most complex — and most lucrative — group events are **citywide conventions**: large-scale gatherings that exceed the capacity of any single hotel and require room blocks spread across multiple properties in a destination. Events like the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, the American Academy of Ophthalmology's annual meeting, or the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago can generate tens of thousands of room nights across dozens of hotels.

In a citywide, the CVB or its affiliated **housing bureau** manages the room allocation process. The housing bureau serves as the central coordinating body, negotiating room blocks with participating hotels, managing attendee reservations through a centralized booking portal, and tracking pickup across the entire block. Hotels are typically designated into tiers:

- **Headquarter hotel(s):** The primary property (or properties) hosting the convention's main sessions, exhibit hall, and VIP functions. The HQ hotel receives the largest room block, the most meeting-space revenue, and the highest visibility — but also bears the greatest operational burden and must offer competitive rates and concessions to win the designation.
- **Overflow hotels:** Properties that absorb room demand beyond the headquarter hotel's capacity. Overflow hotels benefit from guaranteed occupancy during the event but typically receive smaller blocks and less ancillary revenue.
- **Peripheral properties:** Hotels outside the official block that may still benefit from demand spillover, often at higher transient rates since they are not bound by the negotiated group rate.

The economics of a citywide can be transformative for a destination. A single large medical or technology convention can generate $50–$100 million in direct spending across hotels, restaurants, transportation, and entertainment venues in the host city (Events Industry Council, 2024). 

### Hotel Sales Teams and the Property Tech Stack

The hotel sales team remains the primary engine of group distribution. In a full-service hotel, the sales department is typically organized by market segment (corporate, association, wedding/social, SMERF) or by geographic territory. Key roles include:

- **Director of Sales (DOS) or Director of Sales & Marketing (DOSM):** Sets overall group strategy, manages the team, and personally handles the largest accounts.
- **Sales Managers:** Manage portfolios of accounts, respond to RFPs, conduct site visits, negotiate contracts, and build long-term planner relationships.
- **Convention Services Managers (CSMs):** Take over after the contract is signed, managing all operational details of the event — meeting-room setups, catering, AV, and billing.
- **Revenue Management:** Works in partnership with sales to evaluate group opportunities, set pricing guidelines, and conduct displacement analyses.

To execute these strategies, property teams rely on specialized **Sales and Catering (S&C) systems**—such as Amadeus Delphi or Oracle OPERA Cloud Sales and Event Management. These platforms serve as the operational hubs for group distribution. They track RFP statuses, manage meeting space inventory (preventing double-booking of ballrooms), generate contracts, and create the Banquet Event Orders (BEOs) that guide the convention services and culinary teams. The seamless integration of the S&C system with the hotel's Property Management System (PMS) and Revenue Management System (RMS) is critical for accurate forecasting and billing.

### The Role of Third-Party Intermediaries

Beyond CVBs, several types of intermediaries operate in the group space:

**Third-Party Meeting Planners and Procurement Companies.** Organizations like HelmsBriscoe, ConferenceDirect, and Meetings & Incentives Worldwide act as intermediaries between corporate clients and hotels, leveraging their volume and market knowledge to negotiate favorable rates and concessions on behalf of planners. These firms typically earn a commission of 7–10 percent of the room revenue, paid by the hotel — not the client (Fenich, 2023). For hotels, this commission is the cost of access to a pipeline of qualified group leads. HelmsBriscoe, the largest such firm, has placed more than $6 billion in cumulative hotel revenue across thousands of events worldwide (HelmsBriscoe, 2024).

**Housing Bureaus.** For large conventions, housing bureaus manage the room-block allocation across multiple hotels, often using platforms like Passkey (now part of Cvent) to provide a centralized booking portal for attendees. 

**Sports Commissions.** Similar to CVBs but focused specifically on sports events, these organizations help rights holders and tournament organizers source host cities and negotiate hotel blocks.

### International Group Distribution

Group distribution mechanics vary significantly across global markets. In Europe and parts of Asia, the role of the **Professional Congress Organizer (PCO)** is far more prominent than in North America. A PCO manages the end-to-end logistics of a conference or congress — from abstract submission and speaker management to venue sourcing, accommodation booking, and on-site operations. The International Association of Professional Congress Organisers (IAPCO) represents PCOs in more than 40 countries (IAPCO, 2024).

In many European and Asian markets, the congress and convention landscape operates differently from the U.S. model:
- **Government and academic involvement** in conference planning is more common.
- **Net rate contracting** is more prevalent, particularly in markets like Southeast Asia and Southern Europe, where hotels provide PCOs and destination management companies with confidential net rates. The intermediary then adds its margin before selling to the end client. 
- **International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA)** data shows that Europe hosted approximately 53 percent of all international association meetings in 2023, with Asia-Pacific accounting for 18 percent (ICCA, 2024).

> **Question:** What type of intermediary is the local firm, and what pricing model is being used?
> *Answer:* The firm is acting as a Professional Congress Organizer (PCO) or Destination Management Company (DMC), and the pricing model is a *net rate* contract (as opposed to the commission-based model more common in the U.S.).

## 5.3 Group Pricing Strategies

Setting the right rate for a group is one of the most nuanced decisions in hotel commercial strategy. Unlike transient pricing, which can be adjusted dynamically in real time, group rates are negotiated and contracted — sometimes years in advance — locking in a price that the hotel must live with regardless of how demand conditions evolve.

### Common Approaches

**Percentage off BAR.** The most common approach: the hotel offers the group a fixed discount — typically 10–25 percent — off the best available rate (BAR) at the time of booking or at a specified future date. This method is simple and transparent but carries risk for both parties. If BAR rises significantly before the event, the group gets a windfall; if BAR drops, the hotel may find itself honoring a rate that is actually *above* the prevailing market price.

**Flat negotiated rate.** The hotel and planner agree on a specific dollar amount per night, irrespective of BAR fluctuations. This provides certainty for both sides and simplifies budgeting for the planner. 

**Cost-plus pricing.** Particularly common in F&B-heavy events, the hotel calculates its variable cost per occupied room (housekeeping, amenities, energy) and adds a target margin. This approach ensures profitability but requires transparent cost accounting and is more typical of resort and conference-center pricing than urban hotels.

**Ceiling/floor (dynamic group rate).** An increasingly sophisticated approach where the group rate is tied to BAR but bounded by a negotiated floor (minimum) and ceiling (maximum). For example, the rate might be defined as "15 percent off BAR, with a floor of $169 and a ceiling of $219." This protects both parties: the hotel is guaranteed a minimum rate, and the group is protected from rate spikes. Dynamic group rates represent an application of revenue management principles to the traditionally static world of group pricing (Cross et al., 2009). 

Despite significant theoretical advances in dynamic pricing and channel management, practical implementation in the group segment remains uneven. As Vives, Jacob, and Payeras (2018) noted in their comprehensive review of hotel revenue management, group pricing optimization is often one of the least systematized areas of the discipline, relying heavily on manual negotiation rather than algorithmic precision.

**Bid rate / net rate for intermediaries.** When a group is sourced through a third-party intermediary such as HelmsBriscoe or ConferenceDirect, the hotel must factor the intermediary's commission (typically 7–10 percent of room revenue) into its rate calculation. The economic impact is clear: the hotel's effective revenue per room night is reduced by the commission, which must be reflected in the displacement analysis.

### The Total Revenue Lens

Experienced revenue managers evaluate group pricing not in isolation but through a **total revenue** lens. A group offering a below-average room rate might still be the most profitable piece of business on the books when F&B minimums, meeting-space revenue, AV charges, and ancillary spending are factored in. Conversely, a group with an attractive room rate but minimal ancillary contribution may be less valuable than it appears.

This is why the most sophisticated hotel companies have moved from "rooms revenue management" to "total hotel revenue management" — evaluating every group opportunity against the full spectrum of revenue and profit it generates (Kimes, 2016).

## 5.4 Group vs. Transient Revenue Management: Displacement Analysis

The most consequential analytical framework in group revenue management is **displacement analysis** — the process of evaluating whether accepting a group block at a negotiated rate will generate more total profit than the transient demand it would displace.

### The Logic of Displacement

Hotels have a fixed number of rooms on any given night. Every room sold to a group guest at a discounted rate is a room that cannot be sold to a potential transient guest who might pay a higher rate. Displacement analysis quantifies this trade-off.

A thorough displacement analysis considers multiple revenue streams (Rooms, F&B, Meeting Space, Ancillaries) and, crucially, the variable costs associated with servicing that business.

### From Revenue-Based to Profit-Based Displacement

A revenue-only analysis can be dangerously misleading because it ignores the variable costs each occupied room and each F&B cover generates. Two key cost drivers transform the calculation:

- **Cost Per Occupied Room (CPOR):** The variable cost of servicing each sold room — housekeeping labor, linens, amenities, energy, and wear-and-tear. A typical full-service hotel's CPOR ranges from $35 to $65 per night.
- **F&B Cost of Sales:** The variable cost of food and beverage — ingredients, kitchen labor, and service staff — typically running 30–40% of F&B revenue for banquet and group catering.

To illustrate why profit-based analysis is essential for graduate-level revenue management, consider the following step-by-step worked example.

> **🧮 WORKED NUMERICAL EXAMPLE: Profit-Based Displacement Analysis**
> 
> **The Scenario:** A hotel has 350 rooms available. A group requests 200 rooms on a peak night at a negotiated rate of $179. If the hotel accepts the group, it can still sell its remaining 150 rooms to transient guests at $229. If it declines the group, it forecasts it can sell 280 rooms to transient guests at $229 (leaving 70 rooms empty). 
> 
> **Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue (The Flawed Approach)**
> *   **Accept Group:** 
>     *   Rooms: (200 group × $179) + (150 transient × $229) = $70,150
>     *   F&B + Meeting Space: $22,000 (group F&B) + $4,500 (transient F&B) + $8,000 (space) = $34,500
>     *   *Total Revenue = $104,650*
> *   **Decline Group (Transient Only):**
>     *   Rooms: 280 transient × $229 = $64,120
>     *   F&B: $8,400 (transient F&B only)
>     *   *Total Revenue = $72,520*
> *   *Revenue Conclusion:* Accepting the group generates **$32,130** more in top-line revenue.
> 
> **Step 2: Calculate Variable Costs**
> Assume CPOR is $45, F&B Cost of Sales is 35%, and the group intermediary takes an 8% commission on group room revenue.
> *   **Accept Group Costs:**
>     *   CPOR: 350 total rooms sold × $45 = $15,750
>     *   F&B Cost: $26,500 total F&B × 0.35 = $9,275
>     *   Group Commission: (200 × $179) × 0.08 = $2,864
>     *   Other Group Costs (AV setup, comp rooms): $1,500
>     *   *Total Variable Costs = $29,389*
> *   **Decline Group Costs:**
>     *   CPOR: 280 rooms sold × $45 = $12,600
>     *   F&B Cost: $8,400 × 0.35 = $2,940
>     *   *Total Variable Costs = $15,540*
> 
> **Step 3: Calculate Incremental Profit (The Correct Approach)**
> *   **Accept Group Profit:** $104,650 (Rev) - $29,389 (Cost) = **$75,261**
> *   **Decline Group Profit:** $72,520 (Rev) - $15,540 (Cost) = **$56,980**
> 
> **The Takeaway:** The group still wins, but the profit gap narrows from $32,130 (revenue-based) to **$18,281** (profit-based). The group's higher F&B cost of sales and intermediary commissions consume a meaningful share of its revenue advantage. In tighter scenarios, a profit-based analysis can flip the decision entirely.

### Group Wash and Slippage

Displacement analysis requires understanding **group wash** — also called **slippage** — the historical pattern by which groups consistently pick up fewer rooms than they block. 

Here's how it works: A convention contracts a block of 500 room nights, but historical data shows that this organization's attendees have picked up only 80–85 percent of the block in each of the last three events. A savvy revenue manager applies this historical wash factor to the forecast, projecting actual pickup of 400–425 rooms rather than the full 500. The remaining 75–100 rooms can then be made available for transient sale.

Failing to account for wash leads to one of two costly errors:
- **Overblocking without wash adjustment** means the hotel turns away transient guests to protect rooms that will never be picked up — leaving inventory unsold.
- **Over-correcting for wash** means the hotel sells rooms it may need for the group, potentially walking contracted guests to other properties — damaging the relationship and incurring relocation costs.

### The Role of Revenue Management Systems

Modern RMS platforms increasingly incorporate group evaluation tools that automate elements of displacement analysis. Systems from IDeaS, Duetto, and Atomize can integrate group proposals with transient demand forecasts to provide data-driven recommendations. 

The inherently complex and relationship-driven nature of group negotiations means that human judgment remains essential. However, relying solely on intuition carries risks. Schwartz and Cohen (2004) demonstrated that revenue managers exhibit systematic cognitive biases during displacement analysis, often overestimating group value in certain scenarios while underestimating it in others. To counter these biases, more sophisticated quantitative forecasting methods can significantly improve the accuracy of group-versus-transient trade-off decisions (Pereira, 2016). Modern RMS platforms provide this data-driven baseline, complementing rather than replacing expert judgment.

> **🛑 CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 5.3**
> **Scenario:** A hotel is evaluating a wedding block that requests 50 rooms at $200/night. The hotel forecasts it could sell those same 50 rooms to transient guests at $250/night. The wedding will generate $15,000 in F&B revenue (with a 40% cost of sales). The transient guests would generate $0 in F&B. CPOR is $50. 
> **Question:** Based on incremental profit, should the hotel accept the wedding block?
> *Answer:* Yes. 
> *Transient Profit:* (50 × $250) - (50 × $50 CPOR) = $12,500 - $2,500 = **$10,000**.
> *Wedding Profit:* Rooms [(50 × $200) - (50 × $50)] + F&B [$15,000 - ($15,000 × 0.40)] = $7,500 + $9,000 = **$16,500**. 
> The wedding generates $6,500 more in profit despite the lower room rate.

## 5.5 Contract Negotiations: Attrition, Cutoff Dates, and Concessions

Group contracts are among the most complex documents in hotel operations. Understanding their key provisions is essential for both hotel professionals and meeting planners.

### Room Block and Rates

The contract specifies the number of rooms blocked by night, the negotiated group rate(s), and the rate type (e.g., single/double occupancy, suite rates). 

### Attrition Clauses

Attrition is the gap between the number of rooms blocked and the number actually picked up (booked) by the group's attendees. Attrition clauses protect the hotel from the revenue loss that occurs when a group fails to fill its block.

**Typical attrition structures include:**
- **Percentage-based attrition:** The group commits to picking up a minimum percentage of the block — commonly 80 percent. If pickup falls below this threshold, the group pays an attrition fee, often calculated as the room rate multiplied by the shortfall in room nights.
- **Sliding-scale attrition:** The penalty increases as the shortfall grows — for example, 50 percent of the room rate for the first 10 percent shortfall, escalating to 100 percent for shortfalls beyond 20 percent.
- **Revenue-based attrition:** Less common but increasingly used, this approach ties the attrition calculation to total revenue (rooms plus F&B) rather than room nights alone.

The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally reshaped attrition negotiations. Planners now routinely negotiate force majeure clauses, reduced attrition percentages, and more flexible cancellation terms than were standard pre-2020 (Meetings Today, 2023).

### Cutoff Dates

The cutoff date is the deadline by which group attendees must book their rooms to receive the group rate. After the cutoff date, unbooked rooms in the block are released back into the hotel's general inventory and sold at prevailing transient rates. Typical cutoff dates range from 21 to 45 days before the event.

Managing the cutoff date strategically is critical. Setting it too early may reduce pickup as attendees procrastinate; setting it too late limits the hotel's ability to resell unused rooms at higher transient rates. 

### Concessions and Comp Room Ratios

Beyond room rates, group contracts typically include a package of concessions — value-added benefits provided to the group. Common concessions include discounted meeting-space rental, complimentary AV packages, upgraded Wi-Fi, and welcome amenities.

The **comp room ratio** — the number of complimentary room nights provided relative to paid room nights — is one of the most closely negotiated elements. Industry standards typically range from 1:40 (one comp room for every 40 paid rooms) to 1:50. From the hotel's perspective, comp rooms represent a tangible cost that must be factored into the group's total profitability calculation. From the planner's perspective, comp rooms are a critical budget tool used to house speakers or staff.

## 5.6 The Rise of Digital Group Booking Platforms

The group booking process has historically been one of the least digitized areas of hotel distribution. While transient bookings moved online in the late 1990s and early 2000s, group bookings remained stubbornly analog. This is changing rapidly.

### Cvent: The Dominant Platform

Cvent has established itself as the leading technology platform for meetings and events. Its Supplier Network connects more than 300,000 hotels with hundreds of thousands of meeting planners worldwide. Key capabilities include:
- **Venue sourcing and RFP management:** Planners can search for hotels, submit RFPs to multiple properties simultaneously, and compare proposals side by side.
- **Event management:** Registration, attendee management, mobile event apps, and post-event surveys.
- **Passkey (housing management):** Centralized room-block management that integrates with hotel PMS systems, enabling real-time pickup tracking.

In June 2023, Blackstone completed its acquisition of Cvent for approximately $4.6 billion, taking the company private (Blackstone, 2023). The transaction underscored the scale and strategic importance of the meetings-technology market.

### Emerging Platforms

Several newer entrants are challenging Cvent's dominance or addressing underserved segments:
- **Groups360:** Founded by former hotel industry executives, Groups360 launched GroupSync, a platform designed to enable "instant booking" for group rooms. In 2023, the company announced partnerships with major brands including Marriott, Hilton, IHG, and Wyndham (Groups360, 2023).
- **HotelPlanner:** Focuses on small-to-midsize group bookings (10–100 rooms), offering a consumer-facing platform and a B2B solution for corporate and sports groups.
- **Tripleseat:** Targets restaurants, hotels, and unique venues, specializing in social events and catering-driven bookings.

### The Promise of Instant Book for Groups

The "holy grail" of group distribution technology is the ability for planners to book group rooms instantly online — without the traditional RFP-and-negotiate cycle. For small meetings (under 25 rooms with limited meeting-space needs), instant booking is increasingly viable. For larger, more complex events, the technology is improving but the human-touch elements of negotiation and customization remain essential (Meetings Today, 2024).

For hotels, instant book opens a new demand segment: the small meeting that was never worth the cost of a full RFP cycle. A department head planning a two-day strategy session for 15 people is unlikely to submit a formal RFP and wait days for responses — but she will book instantly if the option is available. 

### The Data Advantage

Digital group platforms generate a wealth of data that was largely invisible in the analog era. Hotels can now track which planners are searching for their destination, which competitors are winning RFPs they lost, and how their response times compare to market averages. 

This data transforms group sales from an art into a more disciplined science. Furthermore, a hotel's digital footprint plays a crucial role in this ecosystem; research by Lee and Qu (2011) highlights that online reviews and digital information significantly influence group-buying decisions. Consequently, hotels with strong digital reputations possess a distinct advantage on group sourcing platforms. The most effective group sales professionals combine this data literacy with the interpersonal skills to build trust and craft creative solutions.

## 5.7 Group Business Post-COVID: Recovery and Transformation

The COVID-19 pandemic devastated the meetings and events industry. U.S. hotel group revenue plummeted by approximately 73 percent in 2020, according to Smith Travel Research (now CoStar), far exceeding the decline in transient revenue (Smith Travel Research, 2021). 

Recovery has been gradual but transformative. During the height of the crisis, hotels employed a mix of dynamic pricing adjustments and tactical booking strategies—such as highly flexible group terms and revised cancellation policies—to navigate the unprecedented demand shock (Piga, Abrate, Viglia, & De Canio, 2021). These tactical shifts laid the groundwork for the post-pandemic recovery.

### Recovery Trajectory

Group demand recovery lagged transient demand. While U.S. transient RevPAR surpassed 2019 levels by mid-2022, group RevPAR did not fully recover until late 2024 in many markets (CoStar Group, 2025). Several factors contributed to the slower recovery:
- **Corporate travel policy changes:** Many companies reduced their meetings budgets and adopted hybrid meeting formats.
- **Association attendance declines:** Some large associations experienced 10–30 percent attendance declines relative to pre-pandemic benchmarks.
- **Shorter booking windows:** Lead times compressed significantly, with planners booking closer to the event date.

### Structural Shifts

The pandemic accelerated several structural changes in group distribution:
- **Hybrid events:** The integration of virtual and in-person components became standard for many association and corporate events.
- **Smaller, more frequent meetings:** Many organizations shifted from large annual conferences to smaller, more frequent regional gatherings.
- **Increased flexibility demands:** Planners now expect more flexible attrition and cancellation terms.
- **Bleisure integration:** Group attendees increasingly extend their stays for leisure, blending business and leisure travel.

### The Outlook

Despite the disruption, group business remains essential to hotel profitability — and increasingly critical as a margin stabilizer. U.S. hotel EBITDA declined an estimated 2.8% in 2025, squeezed by labor costs rising 9% per available room while rate growth stagnated across most segments (O'Neill, 2025). In this environment, group bookings with their contracted rates, F&B minimums, and ancillary revenue commitments provide revenue certainty that transient demand alone cannot deliver. 

The Events Industry Council's 2024 Global Economic Significance Study estimated that the global business events sector generated $1.5 trillion in direct spending in 2023, supporting 26 million jobs worldwide (Events Industry Council, 2024). As organizations recognize the irreplaceable value of face-to-face connection, group demand is projected to continue its recovery, albeit in a structurally transformed landscape.

## Industry Spotlight: How Marriott and Groups360 Are Reinventing Group Booking

In 2022, Marriott International announced a strategic partnership with Groups360 to launch instant booking for group rooms across its portfolio of more than 8,500 properties worldwide. The initiative, powered by Groups360's GroupSync technology, enables meeting planners to search for available meeting space and guest rooms, view real-time pricing, and book instantly — without submitting an RFP or waiting for a hotel response.

The rollout began with simple meetings (10–25 rooms, basic meeting space) and has gradually expanded to accommodate more complex events. Early results were promising: Marriott reported that instant-booked groups had shorter lead times, higher pickup rates, and lower cancellation rates compared to traditionally booked groups (Marriott International, 2023).

The partnership reflects Marriott's broader strategy of applying transient e-commerce principles to the group segment — reducing friction, accelerating the sales cycle, and capturing small-meeting business that often falls through the cracks of traditional RFP-based sales processes. For the industry, it signals a potential paradigm shift in how group distribution operates: from a negotiation-centric model to a technology-enabled marketplace.

**Discussion Prompt:** What types of group business are best suited for instant booking? What types still require traditional sales processes, and why?

## Chapter Summary

Group distribution is a relationship-driven, strategically complex, and high-value segment of hotel distribution. This chapter has explored the major group subsegments — corporate, association, wedding, sports, and SMERF — and the distinct distribution channels and intermediaries that serve them, including RFPs, CVBs, housing bureaus, hotel sales teams, third-party intermediaries, and digital platforms like Cvent and Groups360. We examined displacement analysis and group wash as critical frameworks for evaluating group opportunities, reviewed group pricing strategies, and detailed the key contractual elements — attrition, cutoff dates, concessions, and comp room ratios — that define group agreements. We also explored citywide conventions, international group distribution through PCOs, and the post-COVID transformation of the meetings industry.

In Chapter 6, we turn to two additional direct booking channels — voice reservations and walk-in guests — that, while smaller in share, continue to play important roles in the hotel distribution ecosystem.

## Discussion Questions

1. A 500-room urban hotel receives an RFP for a 300-room-night block over three nights at a rate 20 percent below its forecasted transient ADR. Transient occupancy is projected at 70 percent for those dates. What additional information would you need to conduct a displacement analysis, and what factors might lead you to accept or decline the group?

2. How has the COVID-19 pandemic changed the balance of negotiating power between hotels and meeting planners? Provide specific examples of contractual terms that have shifted.

3. Compare and contrast the roles of CVBs, third-party meeting planners (e.g., HelmsBriscoe), and digital platforms (e.g., Cvent) in the group distribution ecosystem. How do they complement or compete with one another? Consider the different fee structures each employs.

4. Evaluate the potential of "instant book" technology to transform group distribution. What barriers exist to its widespread adoption for large, complex events?

5. A resort hotel generates 45 percent of its room revenue from weddings and social events. What distribution strategies and contractual approaches should it employ to optimize this segment?

6. **Ethics in displacement:** A 400-room hotel in a mid-sized city receives two competing requests for the same weekend. One is from a national corporate client offering a rate of $199 per night for 200 rooms with a $50,000 F&B minimum. The other is from a local nonprofit hosting its annual fundraising gala — 150 rooms at $149 per night with a $30,000 F&B commitment. The nonprofit has held this event at your hotel for the past eight years and is a beloved institution in the community. The corporate group is clearly more profitable. What should the hotel do, and what factors beyond short-term revenue should inform the decision?
